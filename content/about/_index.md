Hello, and welcome to the site. I originally made this site to teach myself about static web hosting using github. Itâ€™s a great excuse to serve as my blog as well. It is my intent to fill this with my interests over time. Feel free to drop me an email at [virtualbeck@gmail.com](mailto:virtualbeck@gmail.com).
