Our family went to the movies today. I have some thoughts.

Ease of entry: 10/10. We bought tickets online and just scanned a QR code and it printed out our tickets. 1 person took our tickets and tore them. Easy peasy.

Movie cost: 5/10. Paying $50 for a matinee for 2 kids and 2 adults seems a bit overboard. At least it was a good movie. Also, the seats were electric recliners which were comfortable.

Movie: 10/10. The Wild Robot was today's film, and we all loved it. We had actually just finished reading the book together as a family during our nighttime routine. Great adaptation.

Cleanliness: 10/10. So clean I could watch the whole movie!

Food: 2/10. $15 for about 4 cups of popcorn and a 16 ounce drink. $7 for a bottled water. Incredible.

I love going to the movies with my family, but it feels like it is becoming out-priced for what you get. The price is dictated by the free market though. If people start voting with their feet, then the theaters will be forced to lower prices. Until then, let the money be spent like water. $7 water.
