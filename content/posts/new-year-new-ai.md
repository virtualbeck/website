Because new year, new me felt too contrived. I'm going to have a new section of the website called [ai_slop](https://blog.virtualbeck.com/ai_slop/) where I'm ~~forcing~~ asking a local llm (probably lamma3.2:3b) to write webpages based on user input. 

This is, of course, crap content. That needs to be clear upfront. I've tucked it away in the site from the frontpage so as not to risk anyone from accidently reading it and thinking that these are _my_ thoughts.

I'm doing this because I thought it might be a fun exercise. Posting this here now as a placeholder, and I'll update below the script I'm using locally when I get more time. Look in the upper right hand for the link, and enjoy (or not)!

```bash
TODO: put script here
```
