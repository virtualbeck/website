I've heard it said that if you have something that you'd like done, it's not a goal until it is <u>written down</u>. To that point, I submit to you a list of goals I'd like to _at least_ look into this year.
 
In not partucular order:
  - water filtration, how it works, and making my own custom water filter
  - chiptune/lofi album, possible to monitize, but more than likely just to do for fun
  - write an app based on the [pinterest image extractor](../pinterest) idea I have on the blog
  - some device I can hang on the wall that is an one touch incrementor, maybe 3d print
  - auto tracking/displaying daily steps walked, first locally, later on the blog
  - LLM style-guide, downloads a website's content, writes content based on that style
  - design/build a planterbox w/ removable greenhouse top

These are not SMART goals, as they are poorly defined, not time bound, etc etc etc...

As I look into each one of these this year (and next year if they spill over), I'll write about them here in their own post. When that happens, I'll link said post to each one of these ideas here.

What goals have you loosly set for yourself this year? May be a good idea to write them down.
