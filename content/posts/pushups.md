Turning 40 seems to be the real deal as far as feeling like you're old.<!--more--> Recently turning 40, I thought perhaps I could do some pushups to get back into something resembling "in shape". Consequently, I've been told that round is a shape.

Anyway, that instinct to do pushups was quickly replaced by the cold hard reality that is known as physics. Years of cultivating mass has acted against me in this regard, and I had to resign myself to a measly 14 pushups. This was first thing in the morning. As I arm-shakingly completed the 14th on my bathroom floor, I thought "No problem. I'll just do a descending amount throughout the day until I hit 50."

Easy, right? WRONG.

The second wave was going well, until I thought about how many I had done before my arms started shaking. 3. Three. THREE pushups before my arms shook. I squeaked out 12 total, and thanked the stars that the wave was complete.

Third wave was torture. Finished, but barely. Didn't even try 4th and 5th wave. So here I sit now, 2 days later typing to you. My pecs feel used up, as does my desire to push up more reps. 

The question "Why?" may occur to you, as I did me on Sunday. To that, I'd counter, "Why not?" I'm not 80, and would like to get back in the workout slipstream. When I did track & field as a high schooler, pushups were the main thing we did (other than running). Seems to do the job well. When I was 26, I did P90x. Again, pushups were front and center. Noting my current pain in many different muscle groups highlights how broadly pushups can work your body.

I'll for sure continue. Perhaps I'll even post my updates here. Might be a way to keep me true.
