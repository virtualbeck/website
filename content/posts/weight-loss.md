My friends and I are having a challenge between the three of us to lose weight. We all need to drop 20 lbs in 2 months. If you don't hit the minus 20 pound mark by Oct 24th, you have to pay $100 per pound you missed. The max one person will pay is $2000. Split to 2 winners if needed. 

If we all lose 20 pounds, then we are all fat losers! Which makes us winners.

It's been interesting so far. I've eaten _SO_ much differently this last month. Going to veggies and blue cheese dressing has had the most profound impact on satiating hunger in a way that doesn't move the caloric intake _that_ much. Also, I've grown to love peanut butter—the kind that is just nuts, none of that added sugar stuff. Get that noise out of here. So much sugar in everything that is not fresh, really astounding.

Water intake is key. I've been pounding water and the seltzer waters too. It has been just over a month for me, and I'm down from 191.7 --> 180.0 right now. Feeling good. I'd say the hardest thing is _not_ eating when I'm bored. Just watching something on TV? Stomach/Brain: **"WHY NOT EAT?"** If that can be ignored, then the only thing I'll need to change is the amount of walking I do. I average about 2000 steps per day. I'll need to 3x that to move the needle on this back half of the weight loss.

If I can hit 171.7, I think I'll be within the "normal" BMI range.. which is a totally bogus metric to live by. Seems the [calculation](https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/educational/lose_wt/BMI/bmicalc.htm) is way off. Here's my sample data, and the ranges.

```
BMI Categories:
Underweight = <18.5
Normal weight = 18.5–24.9
Overweight = 25–29.9
Obesity = BMI of 30 or greater

Height: 5'10"

BMI: 27.5

Height: 5'10"

```
