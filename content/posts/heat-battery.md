This time of year it is cool in the mornings and warm in the afternoon. For example, today we are slated to have a high of 80F, and it was 39F this morning. Pretty high temp swing. To leverage this, I've started pulling in cool air in the mornings. So much so that the kids complain about the cold.

What do you need? A box fan. That's it.

Why not just turn on the AC? We could, but this gets some fresh air in, and it is way cheaper.

Start by putting your box fan in a window at one end of your house. Best to do it upstairs if possible as the cool air will fall. Point it blowing OUTWARD, and put it on high.

Then, open another window, ideally as far away as possible from the box fan. This will be the entry point of the cool air and will traverse the most direct path to the box fan.

It has been awesome. Cooling my 2k sq ft house takes about 2 hours from 70 -> 60. That's a decent temp here in the south to keep it cool all day long.

There will be some variability for each setup, but that the gist. Put on some warm clothes in the morning and enjoy a nice cup of hot coffee in your chilled heat-battery house.
