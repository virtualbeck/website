Halloween: A Night of Sugar, Sleep, and Sogginess.

I'm still buzzing from our family's Halloween adventure last night. We hit up the neighborhood with the most epic trick-or-treating grounds â€“ a sea of cul-de-sacs that seemed to stretch on forever. The little monsters (aka kids) were determined to collect as much candy as humanly possible, and I've gotta give 'em credit: they didn't let a little rain dampen their spirits.

As we trudged from house to house, our damp tennis shoes squelching in the wet pavement, the kids' excitement only grew. They zipped through each yard, pail of goodies clutched tightly in their hands, while Mom and Dad tried to keep up! They were loving it. Little did we know, our car would later become an impromptu slumber party.

After what felt like an eternity (2 hours), the kids started to show signs of wear. We'd gathered so much loot that it was starting to weigh them down. I started getting requests to "Hold my bucket" All I knew was they were dragging themselves along, candy wrappers clinging to their fingers and clothes like tiny little flags. Eating candy whilst collecting more candy. Like a small candy conveyer belt.

We went to play and hang out at a nearby friend's house and they played for another couple hours while the parents hung out. Great night! When we got home, the kids tumbled out of the car, goodies cast aside, and promptly fell asleep.

As for me? Well, let's just say I'm still recovering from the sugary onslaught. I had like 5 packets of Sweedish Fish, and feel hungover from all the sugar. My kids are now sporting an impressive collection of sugar-fueled tummyaches, sticky fingers, and what can only be described as "super-gross" ruined M&M paper-based wrappers.

Costumes this year were neon skeleton (daughter,4), and Minecraft Warden (son, 9). All in all, it was a solid Halloween outing. They only get so many fun Halloweens before the magic wears off and they become uninterested. It was such a pleasure to see them gleefully run around all night with friends and family. Here's to another year of magic!
