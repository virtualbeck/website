Last week, our family went to Dollywood, in Pidgeon Forge, TN. It was a great time! I wanted to take some time to jot down my thoughts before they became just meatspace between the ears.

Dollywood used to be a Silver Dollar City park, and evidently Dolly Parton wanted a stake in the venture. One stipulation was that I be temporarily renamed to 'Dollywood' the first year. Well, on the first opening day under the new name, attendance was double the average, and the name stuck.

The weather was so great. Cold in the mornings, and warn in the afternoon. I think I went on most of the roller coaster rides with my son and was really feeling my age at the end of the 3rd day. Almost all of the coasters are fun. The wooden one is thunderous (aptly named), and the rest are made of steel. They are all fast and intense. There is one that is called 'Wild Eagle' that is so smooth, and it makes you feel like you are soaring like an eagle. Highly recommend!

One coaster sticks out as a dud, to me at least. Mystery Mine. Why, you might ask. Well, the shoulder bars come down and enshrine your head with a couple inches on either side. About 5 seconds into the ride, there is an _abrupt_ turn that corrects the orientation of the cart from sideways to upright, and it leaves the riders (well, me at least) feeling like my head is the clapper of a very large bell. DONG! Suffice to say, that was the end of rides for daddy that day. Felt like a hangover for about the rest of the day.Â 

Wonderful theme park! Water park was closed for the season, so I can't comment on that. Just.. do something about that minecart ride, please!
