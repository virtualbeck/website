Hello, and welcome to the site. I originally made this site to teach myself about static web hosting using github. Itâ€™s a great excuse to serve as my blog as well. It is my intent to fill this with my interests over time.

I've added some css elements that I've learned via LLMs and YouTube videos. You can see my code for this site from the socials on the [homepage](https://blog.virtualbeck.com). Thanks for visiting!

-Mike
