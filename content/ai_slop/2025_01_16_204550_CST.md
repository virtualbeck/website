In twisted numbers and confusing codes,
Math struggles to unlock its gentle loads.
The struggle's real as troubled minds unfold,
As problems pile high like snow that's cold.

X's and Y's in endless, winding rows,
No solution seems to ease the woes.
The more we try, the more it seems to grow
A never-ending maze where few dare go.

```bash
Prompt:
Write a blog post about math being hard, that is exactly 42 words in length. Post should be in the form of a sonnet.
"Total duration: ~6 seconds"
```
