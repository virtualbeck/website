In twisted numbers, I do find my fate,
A maze of equations, hard to abate.
The problems pile up, a daunting weight,
My brain protests, "Can't we take a break?"

But still I struggle, night and day,
To solve the puzzles that come my way.
The math is hard, it will not sway.

```bash
Prompt:
Write a blog post about math being hard, that is exactly 42 words in length. 
Post should be in the form of a sonnet.
Total duration: ~5 seconds
```
