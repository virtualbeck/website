To install Citrix Workspace Client on NixOS, you can use the Nix package manager which is integrated into NixOS. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you through the process:

1. **Update your NixOS system**:
   It's always a good idea to update your NixOS system before installing new software packages.
   ```bash
   sudo nixos-rebuild switch --upgrade
   ```

2. **Add the Citrix PPA (Personal Package Archive)**:
   Citrix provides an official PPA for their software, but since NixOS uses a package manager instead of traditional APT or YUM repositories, you will need to use a different method.

3. **Create a custom Nix expression**:
   You can create a custom Nix expression file (e.g., `citrix.nix`) in your home directory or any other convenient location.
   ```nix
   { pkgs ? import <nixpkgs> {} }:

   pkgs.mkShell {
     buildInputs = with pkgs; [
       citrix-workspace-client
     ];
   }
   ```

4. **Build the Citrix Workspace Client**:
   Use `nix-shell` to create an environment and install the Citrix Workspace Client.
   ```bash
   nix-shell ./citrix.nix
   ```
   This will download and build the necessary dependencies and then open a shell with the Citrix Workspace Client installed.

5. **Install and Run Citrix Workspace Client**:
   Once inside the `nix-shell`, you can find the Citrix Workspace Client executable in your PATH.
   ```bash
   citrixworkspaceclient --version
   ```
   If it's installed correctly, you should see version information output.

6. **Permanently install (optional)**:
   If you want to keep Citrix Workspace Client available every time you log into NixOS, you can add the package to your `configuration.nix` file.
   ```nix
   { pkgs ? import <nixpkgs> {} }:

   {
     environment.systemPackages = with pkgs; [
       citrix-workspace-client
     ];
   }
   ```
   After adding this line, rebuild your system configuration:
   ```bash
   sudo nixos-rebuild switch
   ```

7. **Launch Citrix Workspace Client**:
   You can now start the Citrix Workspace Client from your applications menu or by running:
   ```bash
   citrixworkspaceclient
   ```

Remember to replace `citrix-workspace-client` with the actual package name if it differs in your Nixpkgs version. This guide assumes that you have a recent enough version of NixOS and nixpkgs where Citrix Workspace Client is available through the default channels. If not, you may need to use an alternative method such as downloading the installer from Citrix's website and building it manually using Nix expressions.
