In twilight's hush, where numbers hold their sway,
Math's mystic language can perplex the mind.
The equations twist and turn to dismay,
Leaving us lost, with calculations left behind.

But still we strive, through trials to prevail,
And conquer fears that math once did unveil.
For in its depths, a hidden truth does sail.
