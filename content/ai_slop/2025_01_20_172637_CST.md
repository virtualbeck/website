You can use the following bash script to calculate the first N terms of the Fibonacci sequence:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

function fibonacci() {
    local n=$1
    declare -A fib_sequence
    fib_sequence[0]=0
    fib_sequence[1]=1
    
    for ((i=2; i<=n; i++)); do
        fib_sequence[$i]=$((fib_sequence[$((i-1))]+fib_sequence[$((i-2))]))
    done

    echo "Fibonacci Sequence up to $n terms:"
    
    for key in "${!fib_sequence[@]}"; do
        echo "$key: ${fib_sequence[$key]}"
    done
}

# Call the function with desired number of terms
fibonacci 13
```

In this script, we define a `fibonacci` function that uses an associative array to store the Fibonacci sequence values. We then calculate and print out the first N terms of the sequence.

Please note that bash is not designed for high-performance computations like matrix operations or very large sequences, so this approach might be too slow for very large inputs. For those cases, you may want to consider using a language like C or Python, which offer better performance capabilities for such tasks.

Also, remember that this script will print out the sequence up to N terms (not 1-indexed). If you want to start counting from index 1 instead of 0, you can adjust your code accordingly.

```bash
Prompt:
write code in bash to calculate Fibonacci sequence to 13th degree

```
