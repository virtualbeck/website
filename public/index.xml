      <title>new year, new ai</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Because new year, new me felt too contrived. I&amp;rsquo;m going to have a new section of the website called &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.virtualbeck.com/ai_slop/&#34;&gt;ai_slop&lt;/a&gt; where I&amp;rsquo;m &lt;del&gt;forcing&lt;/del&gt; asking a local llm (probably lamma3.2:3b) to write webpages based on user input.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is, of course, crap content. That needs to be clear upfront. I&amp;rsquo;ve tucked it away in the site from the frontpage so as not to risk anyone from accidently reading it and thinking that these are &lt;em&gt;my&lt;/em&gt; thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>empathy pills</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;All my life, I&amp;rsquo;ve never shown an immense amount of empathy. Whether that is a product of nature or nurture, I&amp;rsquo;d say nature. My parents love me and we have a great relationship. I&amp;rsquo;m naturally curious and concerned about others&amp;rsquo; feelings, but often I have a cold pragmatic response to emotional output. This has remained a constant throughout my life.. up until I started taking adderall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year, for me, was the year of caffeine. Mike on caffeine was like Mike+. I could do more work, get it done faster, and &lt;em&gt;feel&lt;/em&gt; better physically. Have you heard of Monster energy drinks? Of course you have. You can probably even picture the Monster logo in your mind right now. It&amp;rsquo;s very heavily marketed. The sugar-free drink of choice contains 150mg of caffeine. Based on the product&amp;rsquo;s webpage for my favorite lime green drink in question - Ultra Paradise, it&amp;rsquo;s flavor profile is &lt;code&gt;Kiwi Lime with a hint of Cucumber&lt;/code&gt;. I don&amp;rsquo;t know about that. It has always tasted like a green apple jolly rancher to me. Anyway, with 2 coffees and an Ultra Paradise down the hatch, it was game on. I was hooked on the feeling of ~300mg of caffeine pumping through my body.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A few years ago, I was made aware of a project by just a few people to get linux running on the (then) new apple M1 silcon. It was and is a large effort and was completed rather quickly. I didn&amp;rsquo;t have any computers that had the M1 chip to test, but recently I was able to grab an M2 Mac Mini and load up asahi linux onto it and test.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last week, our family went to Dollywood, in Pidgeon Forge, TN. It was a great time! I wanted to take some time to jot down my thoughts before they became just meatspace between the ears.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dollywood used to be a Silver Dollar City park, and evidently Dolly Parton wanted a stake in the venture. One stipulation was that I be temporarily renamed to &amp;lsquo;Dollywood&amp;rsquo; the first year. Well, on the first opening day under the new name, attendance was double the average, and the name stuck.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;My friends and I are having a challenge between the three of us to lose weight. We all need to drop 20 lbs in 2 months. If you don&amp;rsquo;t hit the minus 20 pound mark by Oct 24th, you have to pay $100 per pound you missed. The max one person will pay is $2000. Split to 2 winners if needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we all lose 20 pounds, then we are all fat losers! Which makes us winners.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>pushups</title>
      <link>https://blog.virtualbeck.com/posts/pushups/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 26 Mar 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://blog.virtualbeck.com/posts/pushups/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;So, I recently hit the big 4-0, and let me tell you, it feels like the universe decided to slap me with a big “Welcome to Old Age!” sticker. In an attempt to shake off the cobwebs, I thought, “Why not do some pushups and get back in shape?” Of course, I was promptly reminded that “round” is indeed a shape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That burst of motivation quickly met the cold, hard truth of physics. After years of cultivating my “mass,” I had to face the music—14 pushups was all I could muster. And this was before my morning coffee! As I grunted through the final rep on my bathroom floor, I thought, “No biggie. I’ll just do fewer reps throughout the day until I hit 50.”&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Why are you the way you are?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, my organization has made the decision for me to move away from a linux workstation to a windows workstation. This comes with many questions, not the least of which is networking. Our organization uses a VPN which users use to connect to internal applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve had the misfortune to be somewhat of a beta tester in this regard, and I&amp;rsquo;ve had intermittent success at reaching internal applications. The only solution that seems to be working at this point is to upgrade from Windows 10 to Windows 11, so that a WSL setting is supported which allows network pass-through from the host OS to the virtual OS.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
