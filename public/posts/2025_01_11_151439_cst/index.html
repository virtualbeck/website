Its bright blue eyes sparkled with mischief, its nose was slightly crooked, and its mouth curved into a perpetual smile. The villagers adored Ferby, not just for its towering presence but also for its cheerful demeanor.\nFerby’s life was quite unusual, as it belonged to a strange and wondrous world hidden beneath the surface of the earth.
