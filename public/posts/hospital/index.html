Hand and finger pain. Allow me to explain.\nWhen I was getting my IV put in at the hospital, the nurse went from left arm to right hand in search of a vein. Apparently she found on in my right hand, rather high up near where my tendons bunch together that control my fingers. Between my middle and ring tendon, about an inch from my wrist. I can brush my left finger over the dot the needle made right now, and it feels like a cold shooting pain in my right ring finger.\nThere is also a bit of bruising on the back of my wrist. I stopped short, mid-sentence to say how much the needle hurt as it went in. She said, “Just hold still, try to relax.” My right hand had tensed up from the pain. I relaxed it and took some deep breaths.\nSo what’s the big deal? I probably wouldn’t be concerned if I hadn’t had passed out in the surgery prep room. Yeah, for the first time in my whole life (41 years) I passed out when there was a needle stuck in me.\nI didn’t say anything at the time because I thought that they were pushing sleepytime drugs in the IV, so I accepted the cold sensation creeping up my right arm and promptly fell asleep. I dreamed.\nA moment later (20 seconds later according to the nurse that was doing my vitals) I came to. “Mike! Mike! Mike!”, I heard as I came back to reality.\nSo… now I’m more worried about my pain in my hand then the pain from where the surgeon cut in and took tissue for biopsy. Not a wonderful place to be in. I thought I’d write it down here as an account while it was still fresh in my mind.\nI’m going to put the link for the pictures here from my google photos for posterity.\nJan 11th\n","wordCount":"432","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://blog.virtualbeck.com/static/mike.webp","datePublished":"2025-01-11T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2025-01-11T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Mike"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://blog.virtualbeck.com/posts/hospital/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Virtualbeck's Blog","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://blog.virtualbeck.com/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://blog.virtualbeck.com/ accesskey=h title="Virtualbeck's Blog (Alt + H)"><img src=https://blog.virtualbeck.com/mike.webp alt aria-label=logo height=36 width=36>Virtualbeck's Blog</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://blog.virtualbeck.com/archives/ title=Archive><span>Archive</span></a></li><li><a href=https://blog.virtualbeck.com/search/ title="Search (Alt + /)" accesskey=/><span>Search</span></a></li><li><a href=https://blog.virtualbeck.com/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://blog.virtualbeck.com/about/ title=About><span>About</span></a></li><li><a href=https://sudoku.virtualbeck.com/ title=Sudoku><span>Sudoku</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li><li><a href=https://blog.virtualbeck.com/ai_slop/ title=ai_slop><span>ai_slop</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://blog.virtualbeck.com/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://blog.virtualbeck.com/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">surgery</h1><div class=post-description>thought dump on my surgical experience</div><div class=post-meta><span title='2025-01-11 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>January 11, 2025</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;3 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;432 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Mike&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/virtualbeck/website/tree/main/content/posts/hospital.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p>Two days ago, I went in to the hospital to have a couple small skin tissues excised.
