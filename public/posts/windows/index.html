Recently, my organization has made the decision for me to move away from a linux workstation to a windows workstation. This comes with many questions, not the least of which is networking. Our organization uses a VPN which users use to connect to internal applications.
I&rsquo;ve had the misfortune to be somewhat of a beta tester in this regard, and I&rsquo;ve had intermittent success at reaching internal applications. The only solution that seems to be working at this point is to upgrade from Windows 10 to Windows 11, so that a WSL setting is supported which allows network pass-through from the host OS to the virtual OS."><meta name=author content="Mike"><link rel=canonical href=https://blog.virtualbeck.com/posts/windows/><link crossorigin=anonymous href=/assets/css/stylesheet.11e7cac8ac5efd083f6785af688d5b7665d17c4c5246b3e9c72e38ee7c1dc513.css integrity="sha256-EefKyKxe/Qg/Z4WvaI1bdmXRfExSRrPpxy447nwdxRM=" rel="preload stylesheet" as=style><link rel=icon href=https://blog.virtualbeck.com/favicon.ico><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=https://blog.virtualbeck.com/favicon-16x16.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=https://blog.virtualbeck.com/favicon-32x32.png><link rel=apple-touch-icon href=https://blog.virtualbeck.com/apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=mask-icon href=https://blog.virtualbeck.com/safari-pinned-tab.svg><meta name=theme-color content="#2e2e33"><meta name=msapplication-TileColor content="#2e2e33"><link rel=alternate hreflang=en href=https://blog.virtualbeck.com/posts/windows/><noscript><style>#theme-toggle,.top-link{display:none}</style><style>@media(prefers-color-scheme:dark){:root{--theme:rgb(29, 30, 32);--entry:rgb(46, 46, 51);--primary:rgb(218, 218, 219);--secondary:rgb(155, 156, 157);--tertiary:rgb(65, 66, 68);--content:rgb(196, 196, 197);--code-block-bg:rgb(46, 46, 51);--code-bg:rgb(55, 56, 62);--border:rgb(51, 51, 51)}.list{background:var(--theme)}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-track{background:0 0}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb{border-color:var(--theme)}}</style></noscript><meta property="og:title" content="windows"><meta property="og:description" content="Why are you the way you are?
