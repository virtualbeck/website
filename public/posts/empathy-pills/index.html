Sorry, nothing really happened. I was self-medicating myself with caffeine for about a year when I was enthusiastically sharing my thoughts with my wife. She, of course, was supportive of me and glad that I found something that helped me feel great and perform with concentration. At the same time, she was concerned about the amount of caffeine I was consuming. As a much more evolved person than me in every way, and certainly my better-half, she suggested that perhaps I have ADHD and caffeine was doing for me what her meds did for her.\nFunny enough, I was diagnosed with ADHD when I was younger (perhaps 13 or 14 years old) but was never medicated. My memory dictates that I was given the choice to take meds or not, and I had chosen to instead try to calm down using my mind over matter. I wouldn’t say I’ve ever struggled with ADHD in my life, but in the context of this story, there always seemed to be an emotional element missing. Did I need this emotion to function in life, or be successful in work? I’d argue, “No.”. Life pressed on and I learned to silently (and largely ignorantly) adapt largely without empathy.\nSo I talked to my doc about the possibility of having ADHD, discussed my unsafe (or at least unsustainable) amounts of caffeine consumption, and the possibility of having 10mg of adderall as a replacement. After a few months of thinking it over, I said yes and had the prescription filled. Overnight game changer. Although everything felt more clear and in focus from a mental standpoint, it wasn’t apparent to me that I had gained a sense of empathy until about a month in. It honestly feels like a new emotion to me. Like someone has been exhaustively trying to convey the color blurple to me through words only, and then finally revealed it with paint and canvas. It was the final piece to understanding a concept I’ve always dimly been aware of.\nSo now I’m on empathy pills, and I’m so glad for the change. If I can convey the feeling to you, the reader, through words it would be this: it almost feels like relating to someone else’s viewpoint or situation until I’m on the verge of crying. Perhaps that’s not actually the correct was empathy is felt for the majority of people. I’ll say this though, it is a vast self-improvement.\n","wordCount":"634","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://blog.virtualbeck.com/static/mike.webp","datePublished":"2024-12-23T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2024-12-23T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Mike"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://blog.virtualbeck.com/posts/empathy-pills/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Virtualbeck's Blog","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://blog.virtualbeck.com/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://blog.virtualbeck.com/ accesskey=h title="Virtualbeck's Blog (Alt + H)"><img src=https://blog.virtualbeck.com/mike.webp alt aria-label=logo height=36 width=36>Virtualbeck's Blog</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://blog.virtualbeck.com/archives/ title=Archive><span>Archive</span></a></li><li><a href=https://blog.virtualbeck.com/search/ title="Search (Alt + /)" accesskey=/><span>Search</span></a></li><li><a href=https://blog.virtualbeck.com/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://blog.virtualbeck.com/about/ title=About><span>About</span></a></li><li><a href=https://sudoku.virtualbeck.com/ title=Sudoku><span>Sudoku</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li><li><a href=https://blog.virtualbeck.com/ai_slop/ title=ai_slop><span>ai_slop</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://blog.virtualbeck.com/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://blog.virtualbeck.com/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">empathy pills</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2024-12-23 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>December 23, 2024</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;3 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;634 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Mike&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/virtualbeck/website/tree/main/content/posts/empathy-pills.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p>All my life, I&rsquo;ve never shown an immense amount of empathy.
