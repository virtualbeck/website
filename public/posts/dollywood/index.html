I think I went on most of the roller coaster rides with my son and was really feeling my age at the end of the 3rd day. Almost all of the coasters are fun.

There is one that is called ‘Wild Eagle’ that is so smooth, and it makes you feel like you are soaring like an eagle. Highly recommend!\nOne coaster sticks out as a dud, to me at least. Mystery Mine. Why, you might ask. Well, the shoulder bars come down and enshrine your head with a couple inches on either side. About 5 seconds into the ride, there is an abrupt turn that corrects the orientation of the cart from sideways to upright, and it leaves the riders (well, me at least) feeling like my head is the clapper of a very large bell. DONG! Suffice to say, that was the end of rides for daddy that day. Felt like a hangover for about the rest of the day. Wonderful theme park! Water park was closed for the season, so I can’t comment on that.
