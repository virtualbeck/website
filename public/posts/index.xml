      <description>This time of year it is cool in the mornings and warm in the afternoon. For example, today we are slated to have a high of 80F, and it was 39F this morning. Pretty high temp swing. To leverage this, I&amp;rsquo;ve started pulling in cool air in the mornings. So much so that the kids complain about the cold.
What do you need? A box fan. That&amp;rsquo;s it.
Why not just turn on the AC?</description>

      <description>Last week, our family went to Dollywood, in Pidgeon Forge, TN. It was a great time! I wanted to take some time to jot down my thoughts before they became just meatspace between the ears.
Dollywood used to be a Silver Dollar City park, and evidently Dolly Parton wanted a stake in the venture. One stipulation was that I be temporarily renamed to &amp;lsquo;Dollywood&amp;rsquo; the first year. Well, on the first opening day under the new name, attendance was double the average, and the name stuck.</description>

      <description>My friends and I are having a challenge between the three of us to lose weight. We all need to drop 20 lbs in 2 months. If you don&amp;rsquo;t hit the minus 20 pound mark by Oct 24th, you have to pay $100 per pound you missed. The max one person will pay is $2000. Split to 2 winners if needed.
If we all lose 20 pounds, then we are all fat losers!</description>

      <description>Our family went to the movies today. I have some thoughts.
Ease of entry: 10/10. We bought tickets online and just scanned a QR code and it printed out our tickets. 1 person took our tickets and tore them. Easy peasy.
Movie cost: 5/10. Paying $50 for a matinee for 2 kids and 2 adults seems a bit overboard. At least it was a good movie. Also, the seats were electric recliners which were comfortable.</description>

      <description>So, I recently hit the big 4-0, and let me tell you, it feels like the universe decided to slap me with a big “Welcome to Old Age!” sticker. In an attempt to shake off the cobwebs, I thought, “Why not do some pushups and get back in shape?” Of course, I was promptly reminded that “round” is indeed a shape.
That burst of motivation quickly met the cold, hard truth of physics.</description>

      <description>Why are you the way you are?
Recently, my organization has made the decision for me to move away from a linux workstation to a windows workstation. This comes with many questions, not the least of which is networking. Our organization uses a VPN which users use to connect to internal applications.
I&amp;rsquo;ve had the misfortune to be somewhat of a beta tester in this regard, and I&amp;rsquo;ve had intermittent success at reaching internal applications.</description>
