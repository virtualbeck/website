      <description>All my life, I&amp;rsquo;ve never shown an immense amount of empathy. Whether that is a product of nature or nurture, I&amp;rsquo;d say nature. My parents love me and we have a great relationship. I&amp;rsquo;m naturally curious and concerned about others&amp;rsquo; feelings, but often I have a cold pragmatic response to emotional output. This has remained a constant throughout my life.. up until I started taking adderall.
Last year, for me, was the year of caffeine.</description>

      <description>A few years ago, I was made aware of a project by just a few people to get linux running on the (then) new apple M1 silcon. It was and is a large effort and was completed rather quickly. I didn&amp;rsquo;t have any computers that had the M1 chip to test, but recently I was able to grab an M2 Mac Mini and load up asahi linux onto it and test.</description>

      <description>Last week, our family went to Dollywood, in Pidgeon Forge, TN. It was a great time! I wanted to take some time to jot down my thoughts before they became just meatspace between the ears.
Dollywood used to be a Silver Dollar City park, and evidently Dolly Parton wanted a stake in the venture. One stipulation was that I be temporarily renamed to &amp;lsquo;Dollywood&amp;rsquo; the first year. Well, on the first opening day under the new name, attendance was double the average, and the name stuck.</description>

      <description>My friends and I are having a challenge between the three of us to lose weight. We all need to drop 20 lbs in 2 months. If you don&amp;rsquo;t hit the minus 20 pound mark by Oct 24th, you have to pay $100 per pound you missed. The max one person will pay is $2000. Split to 2 winners if needed.
If we all lose 20 pounds, then we are all fat losers!</description>

      <description>So, I recently hit the big 4-0, and let me tell you, it feels like the universe decided to slap me with a big “Welcome to Old Age!” sticker. In an attempt to shake off the cobwebs, I thought, “Why not do some pushups and get back in shape?” Of course, I was promptly reminded that “round” is indeed a shape.
That burst of motivation quickly met the cold, hard truth of physics.</description>

      <description>Why are you the way you are?
Recently, my organization has made the decision for me to move away from a linux workstation to a windows workstation. This comes with many questions, not the least of which is networking. Our organization uses a VPN which users use to connect to internal applications.
I&amp;rsquo;ve had the misfortune to be somewhat of a beta tester in this regard, and I&amp;rsquo;ve had intermittent success at reaching internal applications.</description>
