&lt;p&gt;Recently, I saw on a blog (&lt;a href=&#34;https://garry.net/posts&#34;&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt;) a page view counter. Having seen these on webpages for over 30 years now, I wasMaybe this will help you! I wanted to take some time to document the work I’ve finally marked off the TODO list; setting up traefik and various services therein. Perhaps this will help you, but really it’s just my attempt get the info posted here so I can reference it later if needed, and move on. What is traefik? Traefik (pronounced traffic) is a modern HTTP reverse proxy and load balancer that makes deploying microservices easy. &amp;lt;– ripped from github page. I’m using it to host my services (including this page you’re reading now). Some are public, some are private. Some are public behind an auth mechanism. What follows is essentially a dump of my docker-compse.yaml with some secrets/personal obfuscation, with some inline comments to describe what is going on. You can also host a service that is running on another local host with the file provider context. You just mention that, as I did above, and include a matching config file in the directory specified there. Something like this: &amp;ldquo;&amp;ndash;providers.file.directory=/config/&amp;rdquo; This way, you can specify the correct IP:PORT for traefik to use, rather than rely on labels. If you try to specify with labels, you will end up with an IP address assigned by docker within the host machine where traefik is running… which is fine if you don’t want things to work. Check this example out. That’s about it. Thanks for reading, and let me know if you have any questions. struck that I had no idea how they worked. So like any other curiosity, I started searching around.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
