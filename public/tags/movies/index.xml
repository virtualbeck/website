      <description>Our family went to the movies today. I have some thoughts.
Ease of entry: 10/10. We bought tickets online and just scanned a QR code and it printed out our tickets. 1 person took our tickets and tore them. Easy peasy.
Movie cost: 5/10. Paying $50 for a matinee for 2 kids and 2 adults seems a bit overboard. At least it was a good movie. Also, the seats were electric recliners which were comfortable.</description>
