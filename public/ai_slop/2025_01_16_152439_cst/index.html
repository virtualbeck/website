Yes, you read that right – hacked.

And by “all the wrong reasons,” I mean the company’s employees got hacked and stole sensitive information from its highest-profile accounts.\nYes, you read that right – hacked. As in, “unauthorized access” is a nice way of saying “our CEO just walked into his own trap.” But hey, at least it’s a good excuse to finally get around to updating your password… again.\nNow, I’m no security expert (I can barely remember my own login credentials), but even I know that using the same password for every account is a recipe for disaster. Or in this case, a recipe for Twitter’s CEO being roasted by Elon Musk on his actual Twitter account.\nBut seriously, Twitter’s security breach was a major incident, and it raises some important questions about how we prioritize online safety. After all, if our most high-profile accounts can be compromised so easily, what’s to stop hackers from targeting the rest of us?\nOf course, that’s not exactly a new concern – we’ve been warning about this kind of thing for years. But maybe this latest incident is the wake-up call we need? I mean, who needs password managers when you have Twitter hacks, right?\nIn all seriousness, though, Twitter’s security breach should serve as a reminder to be more vigilant online. Update your passwords, enable two-factor authentication, and for goodness’ sake, stop using the same password everywhere.\nAs for Twitter itself, well… let’s just say they’ve got some work to do. First things first: get the CEO his own personal vault (or at least a better password manager). Then maybe invest in some actual security measures? It’s not like hackers are going to get any easier to outsmart or anything.\nIn conclusion, let this be a lesson to us all: even the most powerful social media platforms can fall victim to human error (and not-so-human hacking skills). So next time you’re tempted to use the same password everywhere, just remember – your online identity is only as secure as your next bad decision.\n","wordCount":"362","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://blog.virtualbeck.com/static/mike.webp","datePublished":"2025-01-16T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2025-01-16T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"llama3.2:3b"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://blog.virtualbeck.com/ai_slop/2025_01_16_152439_cst/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Virtualbeck's Blog","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://blog.virtualbeck.com/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://blog.virtualbeck.com/ accesskey=h title="Virtualbeck's Blog (Alt + H)"><img src=https://blog.virtualbeck.com/mike.webp alt aria-label=logo height=36 width=36>Virtualbeck's Blog</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://blog.virtualbeck.com/archives/ title=Archive><span>Archive</span></a></li><li><a href=https://blog.virtualbeck.com/search/ title="Search (Alt + /)" accesskey=/><span>Search</span></a></li><li><a href=https://blog.virtualbeck.com/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://blog.virtualbeck.com/about/ title=About><span>About</span></a></li><li><a href=https://sudoku.virtualbeck.com/ title=Sudoku><span>Sudoku</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li><li><a href=https://blog.virtualbeck.com/ai_slop/ title=ai_slop><span>ai_slop</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://blog.virtualbeck.com/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://blog.virtualbeck.com/ai_slop/>Ai_slops</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Twitter's Never-Ending Cycle</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2025-01-16 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>January 16, 2025</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;2 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;362 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;llama3.2:3b&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/virtualbeck/website/tree/main/content/ai_slop/2025_01_16_152439_CST.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p>&ldquo;The Great Twitter Hack: A Masterclass in How Not to Secure Your Account&rdquo;</p><p>In recent weeks, Twitter has been making headlines for all the wrong reasons.
