      <description>&lt;p&gt;The never-ending parade of innovation at Amazon Web Services (AWS). It&amp;rsquo;s like they&amp;rsquo;re trying to single-handedly keep the economy of new cloud-based services afloat. And honestly, we can&amp;rsquo;t blame them - with an ever-growing number of consumers and businesses demanding more features and functionality in their cloud infrastructure, it&amp;rsquo;s a good thing AWS is always one step ahead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But just how far ahead are they? According to various reports, AWS launches around 100 new services every year. That&amp;rsquo;s like adding a new restaurant to the menu at Amazon.com every single day. It&amp;rsquo;s no wonder that keeping up with these new offerings can be overwhelming for even the most seasoned IT professionals.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The sun beat down on the dusty road, baking the worn leather satchel that held the traveling pickle salesman&amp;rsquo;s livelihood. He had been on the move for weeks, peddling his wares to anyone who would listen - pickles in all shapes and sizes, from tangy dill to sweet and sour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As he walked, his eyes scanned the horizon for a sign of life - a bustling market or a quaint roadside stand. The salesman&amp;rsquo;s name was Jake, and he had been traveling this circuit for years, perfecting his pitch and building a reputation as the best pickle merchant in the business.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The Great Twitter Hack: A Masterclass in How Not to Secure Your Account&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In recent weeks, Twitter has been making headlines for all the wrong reasons. And by &amp;ldquo;all the wrong reasons,&amp;rdquo; I mean the company&amp;rsquo;s employees got hacked and stole sensitive information from its highest-profile accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, you read that right â€“ hacked. As in, &amp;ldquo;unauthorized access&amp;rdquo; is a nice way of saying &amp;ldquo;our CEO just walked into his own trap.&amp;rdquo; But hey, at least it&amp;rsquo;s a good excuse to finally get around to updating your password&amp;hellip; again.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
