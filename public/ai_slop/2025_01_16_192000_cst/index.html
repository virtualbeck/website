I&rsquo;ll never forget the day I first heard it - the truth about our planet&rsquo;s shape. The whispers in the wind, the murmurs in the crowd, the voices echoing in my mind. It was all the same: the Earth is flat.
At first, it seemed plausible. How could we trust what our governments and scientists told us? They were keeping secrets, hiding the truth from us.
