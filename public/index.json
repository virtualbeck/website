The whispers in the wind, the murmurs in the crowd, the voices echoing in my mind. It was all the same: the Earth is flat.\nAt first, it seemed plausible. How could we trust what our governments and scientists told us? They were keeping secrets, hiding the truth from us. The horizon always seems to meet the sky, like a great big wall. And have you ever tried to sail around the world? You can\u0026rsquo;t - because there\u0026rsquo;s no curve.\nI spent hours researching, pouring over ancient texts and scouring the internet for evidence. The Flat Earth Society was my go-to source of information, and their videos were like a beacon in the darkness. They explained it all: the lack of curvature, the way ships disappear over the horizon, the fact that we can\u0026rsquo;t see the edge of the world from high altitudes.\nBut as I dug deeper, something began to gnaw at me. It was like a tiny voice inside my head, telling me that maybe, just maybe, this wasn\u0026rsquo;t entirely true.\nI started noticing little things - the way the stars seemed to shift in the sky as the seasons changed. The way the shadows of mountains and hills stretched out across the landscape. I read about the concept of refraction and how it affects our perception of light.\nAnd then there were the astronauts. What had they seen up there? Had they truly walked on a curved surface, or was it all just some clever editing job?\nI started to question everything. Was the curvature of the Earth really that tiny? Could we truly see it with our own eyes? The more I learned, the more I realized how little I actually knew.\nOne day, while watching an old documentary about the Apollo missions, something clicked into place. The grainy footage, the eerie silence - it all seemed so staged. But what if it wasn\u0026rsquo;t? What if those astronauts really had seen the curvature of the Earth?\nI felt a shiver run down my spine as I watched Neil Armstrong\u0026rsquo;s feet touching down on the moon\u0026rsquo;s surface. It was like I was seeing it for the first time, even though I\u0026rsquo;d already known about it.\nThe more I learned, the less I believed in the flat Earth theory. It was like I\u0026rsquo;d been living in a dream world, and suddenly I woke up to reality.\nNow, when people tell me that the Earth is flat, I just smile and nod. I know the truth - we\u0026rsquo;re standing on a beautiful, vast, spinning sphere, suspended in an infinite universe.\nAnd as for the song that started it all? Well, let\u0026rsquo;s just say it\u0026rsquo;s no longer relevant. Instead, I sing a different tune:\n\u0026ldquo;The world is round, it\u0026rsquo;s true We\u0026rsquo;re floating on the surface of this blue A tiny speck in space and time Connected to the cosmos, one rhyme\u0026rdquo;\nThe shape of reality has shifted, and I\u0026rsquo;m grateful for it.\n","permalink":"https://blog.virtualbeck.com/ai_slop/2025_01_16_192000_cst/","summary":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u0026ldquo;The Shape of Reality\u0026rdquo;\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;ll never forget the day I first heard it - the truth about our planet\u0026rsquo;s shape.

And by \u0026ldquo;all the wrong reasons,\u0026rdquo; I mean the company\u0026rsquo;s employees got hacked and stole sensitive information from its highest-profile accounts.\nYes, you read that right – hacked. As in, \u0026ldquo;unauthorized access\u0026rdquo; is a nice way of saying \u0026ldquo;our CEO just walked into his own trap.\u0026rdquo; But hey, at least it\u0026rsquo;s a good excuse to finally get around to updating your password\u0026hellip; again.\nNow, I\u0026rsquo;m no security expert (I can barely remember my own login credentials), but even I know that using the same password for every account is a recipe for disaster. Or in this case, a recipe for Twitter\u0026rsquo;s CEO being roasted by Elon Musk on his actual Twitter account.\nBut seriously, Twitter\u0026rsquo;s security breach was a major incident, and it raises some important questions about how we prioritize online safety. After all, if our most high-profile accounts can be compromised so easily, what\u0026rsquo;s to stop hackers from targeting the rest of us?\nOf course, that\u0026rsquo;s not exactly a new concern – we\u0026rsquo;ve been warning about this kind of thing for years. But maybe this latest incident is the wake-up call we need? I mean, who needs password managers when you have Twitter hacks, right?\nIn all seriousness, though, Twitter\u0026rsquo;s security breach should serve as a reminder to be more vigilant online. Update your passwords, enable two-factor authentication, and for goodness\u0026rsquo; sake, stop using the same password everywhere.\nAs for Twitter itself, well\u0026hellip; let\u0026rsquo;s just say they\u0026rsquo;ve got some work to do. First things first: get the CEO his own personal vault (or at least a better password manager). Then maybe invest in some actual security measures? It\u0026rsquo;s not like hackers are going to get any easier to outsmart or anything.\nIn conclusion, let this be a lesson to us all: even the most powerful social media platforms can fall victim to human error (and not-so-human hacking skills). So next time you\u0026rsquo;re tempted to use the same password everywhere, just remember – your online identity is only as secure as your next bad decision.\n","permalink":"https://blog.virtualbeck.com/ai_slop/2025_01_16_152439_cst/","summary":"\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;The Great Twitter Hack: A Masterclass in How Not to Secure Your Account\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn recent weeks, Twitter has been making headlines for all the wrong reasons.

One that I didn\u0026rsquo;t really consider. Hand and finger pain. Allow me to explain.\nWhen I was getting my IV put in at the hospital, the nurse went from left arm to right hand in search of a vein. Apparently she found on in my right hand, rather high up near where my tendons bunch together that control my fingers. Between my middle and ring tendon, about an inch from my wrist. I can brush my left finger over the dot the needle made right now, and it feels like a cold shooting pain in my right ring finger.\nThere is also a bit of bruising on the back of my wrist. I stopped short, mid-sentence to say how much the needle hurt as it went in. She said, \u0026ldquo;Just hold still, try to relax.\u0026rdquo; My right hand had tensed up from the pain. I relaxed it and took some deep breaths.\nSo what\u0026rsquo;s the big deal? I probably wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be concerned if I hadn\u0026rsquo;t had passed out in the surgery prep room. Yeah, for the first time in my whole life (41 years) I passed out when there was a needle stuck in me.\nI didn\u0026rsquo;t say anything at the time because I thought that they were pushing sleepytime drugs in the IV, so I accepted the cold sensation creeping up my right arm and promptly fell asleep. I dreamed.\nA moment later (20 seconds later according to the nurse that was doing my vitals) I came to. \u0026ldquo;Mike! Mike!

Whether that is a product of nature or nurture, I\u0026rsquo;d say nature. My parents love me and we have a great relationship. I\u0026rsquo;m naturally curious and concerned about others\u0026rsquo; feelings, but often I have a cold pragmatic response to emotional output. This has remained a constant throughout my life.. up until I started taking adderall.\nLast year, for me, was the year of caffeine. Mike on caffeine was like Mike+. I could do more work, get it done faster, and feel better physically. Have you heard of Monster energy drinks? Of course you have. You can probably even picture the Monster logo in your mind right now. It\u0026rsquo;s very heavily marketed. The sugar-free drink of choice contains 150mg of caffeine. Based on the product\u0026rsquo;s webpage for my favorite lime green drink in question - Ultra Paradise, it\u0026rsquo;s flavor profile is Kiwi Lime with a hint of Cucumber. I don\u0026rsquo;t know about that. It has always tasted like a green apple jolly rancher to me. Anyway, with 2 coffees and an Ultra Paradise down the hatch, it was game on. I was hooked on the feeling of ~300mg of caffeine pumping through my body.\nAt this point in the story is when something happens that makes the main character have to abruptly halt, and take another method. Sorry, nothing really happened. I was self-medicating myself with caffeine for about a year when I was enthusiastically sharing my thoughts with my wife. She, of course, was supportive of me and glad that I found something that helped me feel great and perform with concentration. At the same time, she was concerned about the amount of caffeine I was consuming. As a much more evolved person than me in every way, and certainly my better-half, she suggested that perhaps I have ADHD and caffeine was doing for me what her meds did for her.\nFunny enough, I was diagnosed with ADHD when I was younger (perhaps 13 or 14 years old) but was never medicated. My memory dictates that I was given the choice to take meds or not, and I had chosen to instead try to calm down using my mind over matter. I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t say I\u0026rsquo;ve ever struggled with ADHD in my life, but in the context of this story, there always seemed to be an emotional element missing. Did I need this emotion to function in life, or be successful in work? I\u0026rsquo;d argue, \u0026ldquo;No.\u0026rdquo;. Life pressed on and I learned to silently (and largely ignorantly) adapt largely without empathy.\nSo I talked to my doc about the possibility of having ADHD, discussed my unsafe (or at least unsustainable) amounts of caffeine consumption, and the possibility of having 10mg of adderall as a replacement. After a few months of thinking it over, I said yes and had the prescription filled. Overnight game changer. Although everything felt more clear and in focus from a mental standpoint, it wasn\u0026rsquo;t apparent to me that I had gained a sense of empathy until about a month in. It honestly feels like a new emotion to me. Like someone has been exhaustively trying to convey the color blurple to me through words only, and then finally revealed it with paint and canvas. It was the final piece to understanding a concept I\u0026rsquo;ve always dimly been aware of.\nSo now I\u0026rsquo;m on empathy pills, and I\u0026rsquo;m so glad for the change. If I can convey the feeling to you, the reader, through words it would be this: it almost feels like relating to someone else\u0026rsquo;s viewpoint or situation until I\u0026rsquo;m on the verge of crying. Perhaps that\u0026rsquo;s not actually the correct was empathy is felt for the majority of people.

It was and is a large effort and was completed rather quickly. I didn\u0026rsquo;t have any computers that had the M1 chip to test, but recently I was able to grab an M2 Mac Mini and load up asahi linux onto it and test.\nFirst of all, huge kudos to the team who reverse-engineered the solution, and released the open source project for all to enjoy! What an accomplishment. You can find the homepage here, along with step-by-step instructions on how to get up and running. Wonderful!\nI installed the UI on the first go round, and took it for a spin for a few days. The overall user experience was good, but not as polished or smooth as I\u0026rsquo;d like. Perhaps it was fedora DE that I didn\u0026rsquo;t like, but to me this would be more useful as an always-on, low power server to offload compute to in the form of containers.\nAnd that\u0026rsquo;s about where I\u0026rsquo;ve landed.

We hit up the neighborhood with the most epic trick-or-treating grounds – a sea of cul-de-sacs that seemed to stretch on forever. The little monsters (aka kids) were determined to collect as much candy as humanly possible, and I\u0026rsquo;ve gotta give \u0026rsquo;em credit: they didn\u0026rsquo;t let a little rain dampen their spirits.\nAs we trudged from house to house, our damp tennis shoes squelching in the wet pavement, the kids\u0026rsquo; excitement only grew. They zipped through each yard, pail of goodies clutched tightly in their hands, while Mom and Dad tried to keep up! They were loving it. Little did we know, our car would later become an impromptu slumber party.\nAfter what felt like an eternity (2 hours), the kids started to show signs of wear. We\u0026rsquo;d gathered so much loot that it was starting to weigh them down. I started getting requests to \u0026ldquo;Hold my bucket\u0026rdquo; All I knew was they were dragging themselves along, candy wrappers clinging to their fingers and clothes like tiny little flags. Eating candy whilst collecting more candy. Like a small candy conveyor belt.\nWe went to play and hang out at a nearby friend\u0026rsquo;s house and they played for another couple hours while the parents hung out. Great night! When we got home, the kids tumbled out of the car, goodies cast aside, and promptly fell asleep.\nAs for me? Well, let\u0026rsquo;s just say I\u0026rsquo;m still recovering from the sugary onslaught. I had like 5 packets of Sweedish Fish, and feel hungover from all the sugar. My kids are now sporting an impressive collection of sugar-fueled tummyaches, sticky fingers, and what can only be described as \u0026ldquo;super-gross\u0026rdquo; ruined M\u0026amp;M paper-based wrappers.\nCostumes this year were neon skeleton (daughter,4), and Minecraft Warden (son, 9). All in all, it was a solid Halloween outing. They only get so many fun Halloweens before the magic wears off and they become uninterested.

We all need to drop 20 lbs in 2 months. If you don\u0026rsquo;t hit the minus 20 pound mark by Oct 24th, you have to pay $100 per pound you missed. The max one person will pay is $2000. Split to 2 winners if needed.\nIf we all lose 20 pounds, then we are all fat losers! Which makes us winners.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s been interesting so far. I\u0026rsquo;ve eaten SO much differently this last month. Going to veggies and blue cheese dressing has had the most profound impact on satiating hunger in a way that doesn\u0026rsquo;t move the caloric intake that much. Also, I\u0026rsquo;ve grown to love peanut butter—the kind that is just nuts, none of that added sugar stuff. Get that noise out of here. So much sugar in everything that is not fresh, really astounding.\nWater intake is key. I\u0026rsquo;ve been pounding water and the seltzer waters too. It has been just over a month for me, and I\u0026rsquo;m down from 191.7 \u0026ndash;\u0026gt; 180.0 right now. Feeling good. I\u0026rsquo;d say the hardest thing is not eating when I\u0026rsquo;m bored. Just watching something on TV? Stomach/Brain: \u0026ldquo;WHY NOT EAT?\u0026rdquo; If that can be ignored, then the only thing I\u0026rsquo;ll need to change is the amount of walking I do. I average about 2000 steps per day. I\u0026rsquo;ll need to 3x that to move the needle on this back half of the weight loss.\nIf I can hit 171.7, I think I\u0026rsquo;ll be within the \u0026ldquo;normal\u0026rdquo; BMI range.. which is a totally bogus metric to live by. Seems the calculation is way off. Here\u0026rsquo;s my sample data, and the ranges.\nBMI Categories: Underweight = \u0026lt;18.5 Normal weight = 18.5–24.9 Overweight = 25–29.9 Obesity = BMI of 30 or greater Height: 5\u0026#39;10\u0026#34; Weight: 191.7 BMI: 27.5 Height: 5\u0026#39;10\u0026#34; Weight: 171.7 BMI: 24.6 Oct 16th update: I\u0026rsquo;m doing great. Today I\u0026rsquo;m at 177.9, which is almost 14 lbs down. I\u0026rsquo;ve got 8 days to drop about 6 more pounds. Not excited about that. The amount of food I\u0026rsquo;m taking in is waaaay less that before. If anything this competition has brought to attention the portion sizes I take on when it is not in the forefront of my mind. That and water intake. Always have water close by to curb the hunger. A lot of times when I\u0026rsquo;m feeling hungry, I think it just amounts to being thirsty and my mind is not able to distinguish between the two. I\u0026rsquo;ll post an update at the end.\nNov 2nd update: The contest ended on Oct 24th, and I lost a total of 17 lbs! The winner wound up losing 18, so I had to hand over $50, and it was worth it. Today is Nov 2nd, and I weigh exactly the same amount as 10 days ago. Hopefully 174 lbs is the new normal for me. I\u0026rsquo;ve been averaging 9000 steps a day and eating around 1800 calories.

In an attempt to shake off the cobwebs, I thought, “Why not do some pushups and get back in shape?” Of course, I was promptly reminded that “round” is indeed a shape.\nThat burst of motivation quickly met the cold, hard truth of physics. After years of cultivating my “mass,” I had to face the music—14 pushups was all I could muster. And this was before my morning coffee! As I grunted through the final rep on my bathroom floor, I thought, “No biggie. I’ll just do fewer reps throughout the day until I hit 50.”\n14 12 10 8 6 +-- 50 Easy, right? WRONG.\nThe second round started strong until I remembered how many I struggled to complete before my arms began to quiver. I managed just 3 before the shakes kicked in. In total, I barely squeezed out 12. Thank goodness that round was over!\nThe third wave? Pure agony. I finished, but only just. By the time the fourth and fifth waves rolled around, I waved the white flag. Here I am, two days later, typing this with pecs that feel like they’ve gone through a meat grinder—and my motivation to do more pushups? Well, it’s feeling pretty spent, too.\nYou might be wondering, “Why put myself through this?” To that, I say, “Why not?” I’m not 80 yet, and I’d love to slip back into the workout groove. Back in my high school days of track and field, pushups were a staple (besides running, of course). And let’s not forget P90X at 26—pushups were the name of the game there, too. The aches in various muscle groups now remind me just how effectively pushups work your entire body.\nI’m committed to continuing this journey.

In an attempt to shake off the cobwebs, I thought, “Why not do some pushups and get back in shape?” Of course, I was promptly reminded that “round” is indeed a shape.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat burst of motivation quickly met the cold, hard truth of physics. After years of cultivating my “mass,” I had to face the music—14 pushups was all I could muster. And this was before my morning coffee! As I grunted through the final rep on my bathroom floor, I thought, “No biggie. I’ll just do fewer reps throughout the day until I hit 50.”\u003c/p\u003e","title":"pushups"},{"content":"Why are you the way you are?\nRecently, my organization has made the decision for me to move away from a linux workstation to a windows workstation.

My friend wanted to have his Slack profile picture updated every 5 mins, so he wrote a program in Go to accomplish this. I am not that savvy with Go (yet), and I wanted to do my own implementation in Bash. Below is the code, only 4 lines really. Let’s look at each line and see what it is going on.\n# !/bin/bash # Upload a new picture to Slack profile to indicate your presence # put it in your crontab to send every 5 mins # */5 8–17 * * 1–5 /home/mike/slackProfilePic.sh # capture image from webcam (use /dev/video0 for default webcam) streamer -f jpeg -o /home/mike/image.jpeg -c /dev/video1 # introduce blur convert -blur 0x2 /home/mike/image.jpeg /home/mike/image.jpeg # send to slack (get your slack token here: https://api.slack.com/custom-integrations/legacy-tokens) curl https://slack.com/api/users.setPhoto -F “image=@/home/mike/image.jpeg” -F “token=xoxp-123–456–789” # remove image rm /home/mike/image.jpeg Walkthrough #!/bin/bash This is called the shebang, and it just tells the computer where the program bash lives. Any line that starts with a # means that is it a comment # */5 8–17 * * 1–5 slackProfilePic.sh is a comment, but also an example of how the script can be ran by the computer over and over on a cadence by cron (more here). This specific cron entry will run every 5 mins between the hours of 8am and 5pm, Monday through Friday. streamer -f jpeg -o /home/mike/image.jpeg -c /dev/video1 The capture line. Streamer is a program that captures audio/video. We are using it to just grab one frame from our webcam, and store it on disk in jpeg format. Read more about streamer here. convert -blur 0x2 /home/mike/image.jpeg /home/mike/image.jpeg The blur line (optional). This line was included to introduce a bit of blur to the newly captured image. I wanted to convey presence without sacrificing privacy. You may choose to change the amount of blur or do something completely different before uploading to Slack. Read more about convert here]. curl https://slack.com/api/users.setPhoto -F “image=@/home/mike/image.jpeg” -F “token=xoxp-123–456–789” The upload line. Here, a curl request is used to send the new image to your Slack profile picture, using your Slack token. Much more can be found here about curl, and you can get your own token (and replace this one) here. rm /home/mike/image.jpeg The cleanup line. This line merely removes the local copy of the image we just uploaded to Slack. That’s it! I hope you found this useful, and are able to convey your online presence (or lack thereof) using the tools available through Linux.\n","permalink":"https://blog.virtualbeck.com/posts/slack-and-bash/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eLet’s write a script to take and upload pictures\u003c/p\u003e","title":"Bash plus Slack"},{"content":"Let’s write a script to run Plex in docker\nPlex is great. Host all your media in your own hardware. Upgrading Plex from a binary is not great. Letting docker run latest is the easiest way I’ve found to upgrade. First, you have to make a few dirs, but it is straight-forward.\nmkdir -p /mnt/data/plex/db mkdir -p /mnt/data/plex/tmp Great, now we have our folder structure. Now we will create a script to start plex in docker. Open a new file: nano startPlex.sh and copy this into it.\n#!/bin/bash docker run \\ -d \\ # run in daemon mode --name plex \\ --network=host \\ # use NIC card of host machine -e TZ=\u0026#34;America/Chicago\u0026#34; \\ # enter your timezone -e PLEX_CLAIM=\u0026#34;claim-xxxyyyzzz\u0026#34; \\ # https://www.plex.tv/claim/ -h localhost \\ # hostname -v /mnt/data/plex/db:/config \\ # mapping config dir -v /mnt/data/plex/tmp:/transcode \\ # mapping transcode dir -v /mnt/data:/data \\ # mapping data dir --restart=always \\ # restart in event of a failed container linuxserver/plex:latest # image source After that, just make the file executable by running chmod +x startPlex.sh and then ./startPlex.sh.
