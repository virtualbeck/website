[{"content":"The sun was setting over the bustling streets of Tokyo, casting a warm orange glow over the crowded market stalls and food vendors. Amidst the chaos, one man stood out - Takashi, the traveling pickle salesman. He had been peddling his delicious, hand-crafted pickles for years, but today felt different.\nTakashi had received an invitation from none other than the infamous Chef Katsuhiko, a renowned culinary master in Tokyo\u0026rsquo;s esteemed kitchens. The chef was known for his exacting standards and discerning palate, but Takashi was determined to win him over.\nWith a spring in his step and a twinkle in his eye, Takashi set up his stall, carefully arranging his colorful jars of pickles on display. He had spent weeks perfecting the recipe, experimenting with different spices and flavors until he landed on his signature \u0026ldquo;Tokyo Sunset\u0026rdquo; pickle - a symphony of sweet, tangy, and smoky notes that would surely impress even the most discerning palate.\nAs the crowds began to swell, Takashi took his place behind the stall, greeting customers with a warm smile and a sample of his finest pickles. The day wore on, with potential clients sampling and savoring, but none seemed quite right for the elusive Chef Katsuhiko.\nJust as Takashi was about to pack up and head home, he spotted him - the chef himself, striding through the market with an entourage of assistants. Takashi\u0026rsquo;s heart skipped a beat as he hastily rearranged his stall, positioning his jars in perfect alignment and polishing the briny sheen on his glasses.\nChef Katsuhiko halted before Takashi\u0026rsquo;s stall, his piercing gaze scanning the array of pickles before him. For what felt like an eternity, the two men stood locked in silence, each waiting for the other to make a move. Finally, Chef Katsuhiko extended a hand, beckoning Takashi forward.\n\u0026ldquo;Ah, Takashi-san,\u0026rdquo; he said in a low, rumbling voice, \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ve heard so much about your pickles. I must say, I\u0026rsquo;m intrigued.\u0026rdquo;\nTakashi\u0026rsquo;s eyes shone with excitement as he shook the chef\u0026rsquo;s hand. \u0026ldquo;It would be an honor to serve you, Chef Katsuhiko-sensei!\u0026rdquo;\nWith a wave of his hand, the chef invited Takashi to join him on a private tour of the market. Together, they navigated the stalls, sampling and discussing the finer points of Japanese cuisine.\nAs the evening drew to a close, Takashi presented Chef Katsuhiko with a carefully selected jar of \u0026ldquo;Tokyo Sunset\u0026rdquo; pickles, adorned with a hand-painted label bearing his logo. The chef\u0026rsquo;s eyes narrowed as he examined the jar, then raised it to his nose and inhaled deeply.\nThe silence that followed was oppressive, until finally, Chef Katsuhiko spoke up - \u0026ldquo;These are indeed remarkable pickles, Takashi-san. I can already envision them paired with a perfectly seared Wagyu beef, or nestled within a delicate tempura shell.\u0026rdquo;\nTakashi beamed, his face flushed with pride. \u0026ldquo;Thank you, Chef Katsuhiko-sensei! It would be an absolute privilege to have my pickles featured in your esteemed kitchens!\u0026rdquo;\nAs the night drew to a close and Takashi packed up his stall, he felt like he was walking on air. He had given it his all, pouring every ounce of passion and dedication into his craft, and now the universe was rewarding him.\nThe next morning, Takashi received an email from Chef Katsuhiko himself - \u0026ldquo;Dear Takashi-san,\nI am pleased to inform you that I will be featuring your \u0026lsquo;Tokyo Sunset\u0026rsquo; pickles in my restaurant\u0026rsquo;s new seasonal menu. Your hard work and dedication have paid off, and I look forward to working with you.\nSincerely, Chef Katsuhiko\u0026rdquo;\nTakashi couldn\u0026rsquo;t contain his joy. He leapt out of bed, phoning his family to share the news, before embarking on a whirlwind tour of Tokyo\u0026rsquo;s culinary hotspots, ready to showcase his pickles to an even wider audience.\nAs he set off into the sunset, Takashi knew that this was just the beginning - the start of a lifelong journey as the pickle salesman to Chef Katsuhiko and all the other culinary masters who would come to appreciate his craft.\nPrompt: Please write a story about a traveling pickle salesman who has been giving a once in a lifetime chance to sell his pickles to his dream client.

One that I didn\u0026rsquo;t really consider. Hand and finger pain. Allow me to explain.\nWhen I was getting my IV put in at the hospital, the nurse went from left arm to right hand in search of a vein. Apparently she found on in my right hand, rather high up near where my tendons bunch together that control my fingers. Between my middle and ring tendon, about an inch from my wrist. I can brush my left finger over the dot the needle made right now, and it feels like a cold shooting pain in my right ring finger.\nThere is also a bit of bruising on the back of my wrist. I stopped short, mid-sentence to say how much the needle hurt as it went in. She said, \u0026ldquo;Just hold still, try to relax.\u0026rdquo; My right hand had tensed up from the pain. I relaxed it and took some deep breaths.\nSo what\u0026rsquo;s the big deal? I probably wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be concerned if I hadn\u0026rsquo;t had passed out in the surgery prep room. Yeah, for the first time in my whole life (41 years) I passed out when there was a needle stuck in me.\nI didn\u0026rsquo;t say anything at the time because I thought that they were pushing sleepytime drugs in the IV, so I accepted the cold sensation creeping up my right arm and promptly fell asleep. I dreamed.\nA moment later (20 seconds later according to the nurse that was doing my vitals) I came to. \u0026ldquo;Mike! Mike! Mike!\u0026rdquo;, I heard as I came back to reality.\nSo\u0026hellip; now I\u0026rsquo;m more worried about my pain in my hand then the pain from where the surgeon cut in and took tissue for biopsy.

Whether that is a product of nature or nurture, I\u0026rsquo;d say nature. My parents love me and we have a great relationship. I\u0026rsquo;m naturally curious and concerned about others\u0026rsquo; feelings, but often I have a cold pragmatic response to emotional output. This has remained a constant throughout my life.. up until I started taking adderall.\nLast year, for me, was the year of caffeine. Mike on caffeine was like Mike+. I could do more work, get it done faster, and feel better physically. Have you heard of Monster energy drinks? Of course you have. You can probably even picture the Monster logo in your mind right now. It\u0026rsquo;s very heavily marketed. The sugar-free drink of choice contains 150mg of caffeine. Based on the product\u0026rsquo;s webpage for my favorite lime green drink in question - Ultra Paradise, it\u0026rsquo;s flavor profile is Kiwi Lime with a hint of Cucumber. I don\u0026rsquo;t know about that. It has always tasted like a green apple jolly rancher to me. Anyway, with 2 coffees and an Ultra Paradise down the hatch, it was game on. I was hooked on the feeling of ~300mg of caffeine pumping through my body.\nAt this point in the story is when something happens that makes the main character have to abruptly halt, and take another method. Sorry, nothing really happened. I was self-medicating myself with caffeine for about a year when I was enthusiastically sharing my thoughts with my wife. She, of course, was supportive of me and glad that I found something that helped me feel great and perform with concentration. At the same time, she was concerned about the amount of caffeine I was consuming. As a much more evolved person than me in every way, and certainly my better-half, she suggested that perhaps I have ADHD and caffeine was doing for me what her meds did for her.\nFunny enough, I was diagnosed with ADHD when I was younger (perhaps 13 or 14 years old) but was never medicated. My memory dictates that I was given the choice to take meds or not, and I had chosen to instead try to calm down using my mind over matter. I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t say I\u0026rsquo;ve ever struggled with ADHD in my life, but in the context of this story, there always seemed to be an emotional element missing. Did I need this emotion to function in life, or be successful in work? I\u0026rsquo;d argue, \u0026ldquo;No.\u0026rdquo;. Life pressed on and I learned to silently (and largely ignorantly) adapt largely without empathy.\nSo I talked to my doc about the possibility of having ADHD, discussed my unsafe (or at least unsustainable) amounts of caffeine consumption, and the possibility of having 10mg of adderall as a replacement. After a few months of thinking it over, I said yes and had the prescription filled. Overnight game changer. Although everything felt more clear and in focus from a mental standpoint, it wasn\u0026rsquo;t apparent to me that I had gained a sense of empathy until about a month in. It honestly feels like a new emotion to me. Like someone has been exhaustively trying to convey the color blurple to me through words only, and then finally revealed it with paint and canvas. It was the final piece to understanding a concept I\u0026rsquo;ve always dimly been aware of.\nSo now I\u0026rsquo;m on empathy pills, and I\u0026rsquo;m so glad for the change. If I can convey the feeling to you, the reader, through words it would be this: it almost feels like relating to someone else\u0026rsquo;s viewpoint or situation until I\u0026rsquo;m on the verge of crying. Perhaps that\u0026rsquo;s not actually the correct was empathy is felt for the majority of people. I\u0026rsquo;ll say this though, it is a vast self-improvement.\n","permalink":"https://blog.virtualbeck.com/posts/empathy-pills/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eAll my life, I\u0026rsquo;ve never shown an immense amount of empathy.

Lovely!\nI\u0026rsquo;ve been very impressed, and truly hope that the asahi linux team releases support for future apple silicon models.\nSide note: I was able to dual-boot this machine, so it runs MacOS too, and ollama runs natively on Apple silicon\u0026hellip;and it is fast.

They zipped through each yard, pail of goodies clutched tightly in their hands, while Mom and Dad tried to keep up! They were loving it. Little did we know, our car would later become an impromptu slumber party.\nAfter what felt like an eternity (2 hours), the kids started to show signs of wear. We\u0026rsquo;d gathered so much loot that it was starting to weigh them down.

Split to 2 winners if needed.\nIf we all lose 20 pounds, then we are all fat losers! Which makes us winners.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s been interesting so far. I\u0026rsquo;ve eaten SO much differently this last month. Going to veggies and blue cheese dressing has had the most profound impact on satiating hunger in a way that doesn\u0026rsquo;t move the caloric intake that much. Also, I\u0026rsquo;ve grown to love peanut butter—the kind that is just nuts, none of that added sugar stuff. Get that noise out of here. So much sugar in everything that is not fresh, really astounding.\nWater intake is key. I\u0026rsquo;ve been pounding water and the seltzer waters too. It has been just over a month for me, and I\u0026rsquo;m down from 191.7 \u0026ndash;\u0026gt; 180.0 right now. Feeling good. I\u0026rsquo;d say the hardest thing is not eating when I\u0026rsquo;m bored. Just watching something on TV? Stomach/Brain: \u0026ldquo;WHY NOT EAT?\u0026rdquo; If that can be ignored, then the only thing I\u0026rsquo;ll need to change is the amount of walking I do. I average about 2000 steps per day. I\u0026rsquo;ll need to 3x that to move the needle on this back half of the weight loss.\nIf I can hit 171.7, I think I\u0026rsquo;ll be within the \u0026ldquo;normal\u0026rdquo; BMI range.. which is a totally bogus metric to live by. Seems the calculation is way off. Here\u0026rsquo;s my sample data, and the ranges.\nBMI Categories: Underweight = \u0026lt;18.5 Normal weight = 18.5–24.9 Overweight = 25–29.9 Obesity = BMI of 30 or greater Height: 5\u0026#39;10\u0026#34; Weight: 191.7 BMI: 27.5 Height: 5\u0026#39;10\u0026#34; Weight: 171.7 BMI: 24.6 Oct 16th update: I\u0026rsquo;m doing great. Today I\u0026rsquo;m at 177.9, which is almost 14 lbs down. I\u0026rsquo;ve got 8 days to drop about 6 more pounds. Not excited about that. The amount of food I\u0026rsquo;m taking in is waaaay less that before. If anything this competition has brought to attention the portion sizes I take on when it is not in the forefront of my mind. That and water intake. Always have water close by to curb the hunger. A lot of times when I\u0026rsquo;m feeling hungry, I think it just amounts to being thirsty and my mind is not able to distinguish between the two. I\u0026rsquo;ll post an update at the end.\nNov 2nd update: The contest ended on Oct 24th, and I lost a total of 17 lbs! The winner wound up losing 18, so I had to hand over $50, and it was worth it. Today is Nov 2nd, and I weigh exactly the same amount as 10 days ago. Hopefully 174 lbs is the new normal for me. I\u0026rsquo;ve been averaging 9000 steps a day and eating around 1800 calories. Not difficult. Weather has been great for walking and we also have a small walking treadmill for bad weather days.\n","permalink":"https://blog.virtualbeck.com/posts/weight-loss/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eMy friends and I are having a challenge between the three of us to lose weight.
