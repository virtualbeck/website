to this article: A lot of what I\u0026rsquo;m going to say here is a reguritation of this great post from tailscale. If you want to just skip to that document, I will not hold it against you. If you\u0026rsquo;d like to see how I\u0026rsquo;ve implemented a tailscale container with a code-server sidecar container and serve it over my tailnet, then read on!\nTailscale is an excellent implementation of wireguard, which is a VPN. Tailscale is installed on your clients, and lets you connect to your devices as if you were local. You get your own \u0026ldquo;tailnet\u0026rdquo;, which is kind of like your DNS domain. It looks like \u0026ldquo;tailXXXX.ts.net\u0026rdquo;, where the X are numbers. Running a service like code-server (or whatever container) would be available on your tailnet at code-server.tail1234.ts.net, so long as you are connected to your tailnet. You can also, with one boolean change make this sidecar service avilable to anyone on the internet. How much do I pay for this? Zero, baby! It\u0026rsquo;s free tier is up to 3 users (I\u0026rsquo;m using 1), and up to 100 clients (I think I may have 6). Plenty of headroom.\nCode-server is vscode, but in the browser. It is essentailly running a code editor on a server somewhere. Think of it as your dev environment, accessible anywhere. This makes the choice of your company\u0026rsquo;s issued workstation and OS much more trivial, as you will be coding in an IDE that you know and love, and it can be customized and saved to your liking. I\u0026rsquo;m running this locally, but you could easily run it on a cloud provider and have similar results.\nOk, so how do you set this up? It\u0026rsquo;s pretty simple. Have a look at the 2 files needed below. The first is the docker-compose.yml.\nSide note: There is one additional file needed for this, which it the .env file. It sits right beside the docker-compose.yml. I have one that has one line entry: SERVICE_NAME=code-server. I\u0026rsquo;m not enchanted by how docker compose files handle variable interpolation (service names and volumes apperently can\u0026rsquo;t be interpolated??), but this is a bit of a time saver rhebric. services: # main tailscale service ts-code-server: image: tailscale/tailscale:latest container_name: ts-${SERVICE_NAME} hostname: ${SERVICE_NAME} # ${SERVICE_NAME}.tail5080.ts.net endpoint environment: - TS_AUTHKEY=tskey-auth-oaiwdkslfriwe3FAKE-KEYpafokmdfkmaopw94efoisdfklw - TS_EXTRA_ARGS=--advertise-tags=tag:container - TS_SERVE_CONFIG=/config/${SERVICE_NAME}.json - TS_STATE_DIR=/var/lib/tailscale - TS_USERSPACE=false volumes: - ${PWD}/ts-${SERVICE_NAME}/state:/var/lib/tailscale - ${PWD}/ts-${SERVICE_NAME}/config:/config devices: - /dev/net/tun:/dev/net/tun cap_add: - net_admin restart: unless-stopped # sidecar code-server: image: coder/code-server container_name: ${SERVICE_NAME} volumes: # ~/docker-data on host machine is /home/coder/workspace/ in container - ~/docker-data:/home/coder/workspace restart: unless-stopped network_mode: service:ts-${SERVICE_NAME} # \u0026lt;-- this is where the magic happens depends_on: - ts-${SERVICE_NAME} volumes: ts-code-server: driver: local The tailscale config file (listed above in docker-compose.yml as ts-code-server/config/code-server.json)\n{ \u0026#34;TCP\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;443\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;HTTPS\u0026#34;: true } }, \u0026#34;Web\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;${TS_CERT_DOMAIN}:443\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;Handlers\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;/\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;Proxy\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;http://127.0.0.1:8080\u0026#34; } } } }, \u0026#34;AllowFunnel\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;${TS_CERT_DOMAIN}:443\u0026#34;: false } } Finally, in your tailscale admin dashboard, make sure you have MagicDNS and HTTPS Certificates both ENABLED. You can obviosly add more volumes to your sidecar docker container if you want more local filesystems mapped to your container, but this should get you going. That\u0026rsquo;s it! You have your own code-server running on you docker container, which it accessable from anywhere, when you are on your tailnet.\nIf you feel spicy and want to open it (or another container) to the whole world, set the last line in you tailscale config AllowFunnel \u0026ndash;\u0026gt; true. As a side note here, you also have to open up your ACL for funnel, as per the docs. Here\u0026rsquo;s the snippet in my ACLs that did the trick:\n\u0026#34;nodeAttrs\u0026#34;: [ {\u0026#34;target\u0026#34;: [\u0026#34;tag:container\u0026#34;], \u0026#34;attr\u0026#34;: [\u0026#34;funnel\u0026#34;]}, ] This is saying that if the tailscale agent is tagged with container, then add support for the attribute funnel. Then the true/false AllowFunnel will work properly. I think that is it.\n","permalink":"https://blog.virtualbeck.com/posts/tailscale-and-coder-server/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eListen to this article:\n\u003caudio class=\"custom-audio\" controls preload=\"none\" style=\"width: 100%;\"\u003e\n  \u003csource src=\"/audio/tailscale-and-coder-server.mp3\"\u003e\n\u003c/audio\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA lot of what I\u0026rsquo;m going to say here is a reguritation of \u003ca href=\"https://tailscale.com/blog/docker-tailscale-guide\"\u003ethis great post\u003c/a\u003e from tailscale.

It looks like \u0026ldquo;tailXXXX.ts.net\u0026rdquo;, where the X are numbers.

Having seen these on webpages for over 30 years now, I wasMaybe this will help you! I wanted to take some time to document the work I’ve finally marked off the TODO list; setting up traefik and various services therein. Perhaps this will help you, but really it’s just my attempt get the info posted here so I can reference it later if needed, and move on. What is traefik? Traefik (pronounced traffic) is a modern HTTP reverse proxy and load balancer that makes deploying microservices easy. \u0026lt;– ripped from github page. I’m using it to host my services (including this page you’re reading now). Some are public, some are private. Some are public behind an auth mechanism. What follows is essentially a dump of my docker-compse.yaml with some secrets/personal obfuscation, with some inline comments to describe what is going on. You can also host a service that is running on another local host with the file provider context. You just mention that, as I did above, and include a matching config file in the directory specified there. Something like this: \u0026ldquo;\u0026ndash;providers.file.directory=/config/\u0026rdquo; This way, you can specify the correct IP:PORT for traefik to use, rather than rely on labels. If you try to specify with labels, you will end up with an IP address assigned by docker within the host machine where traefik is running… which is fine if you don’t want things to work. Check this example out. That’s about it. Thanks for reading, and let me know if you have any questions. struck that I had no idea how they worked. So like any other curiosity, I started searching around.\nThe first thought I had was that this was some sort of script that went and fetched a value from a database on page load, and either did an increment then, or afterwards. Probably afterwards, so as to keep the webpage snappy.\nThat well may be the way it is done. I\u0026rsquo;m still not sure. As I\u0026rsquo;m writing this post, I have yet to implememnt a page views: into the header of the html. But, I think I\u0026rsquo;ve stood up a portion of the solution which I\u0026rsquo;d like to write about here.\nIn my search for finding this, I was sure to mention to the google gods that whatever I chose, it should play well with Hugo, the static site generator I use to generate this whole site. One of the first results was a Hugo message board where a user was asking advice on the same topic, to which they were told: \u0026ldquo;Why don\u0026rsquo;t you just let google analytics do this?\u0026rdquo;\nEvidently, Hugo (or at least the theme I\u0026rsquo;m using, papermod) has support baked in for google analytics. I clicked the link, and it brought me to the docs on how to do so via Hugo. It was just one line. I\u0026rsquo;d put my google-analytics-id in the base config file, and re-build. Okay - well what does that look like from my standpoint of setting up that part of google?\nThe portal was a signup, and honestly it gave me an uneasy feeling. Like, google would have all the analytics of my website in exchange for a measley page view implementation. So, I kept looking. That lead me to a project named umami.\nYou can click on the link above to read more about it, but I\u0026rsquo;ll give you the gist here. It is an open-source web analytics tool that treats data privacy as a first-class citizen. It is lightweight, and can be self-hosted. So, that is what I\u0026rsquo;m doing now. I\u0026rsquo;ve spun up an umami docker container, and have it running at umami.virtualbeck.com. It collects all sorts of stats, and they are automatically anonymized so as to not identify users. This makes umami GDPR compliant.\nIt can also track actions on the website, like clicks. I have not implemented that yet - but I have implemented the most basic data collection that it comes packaged with. I can basically see page-views and view duration, along with what device and general location (country scale).\nI just added a few lines to my docker compose file, and let traefik handle the rest. Read more about traefik here. I\u0026rsquo;ll list the full setup in my docker compose file below. It refernces an endpoint cloudflare, but that is a cloudflare tunnel, which points back to my home server, so as to serve the traffic without opening up any ports to access my ssytems directly. Read more about it here. It\u0026rsquo;s great, and it\u0026rsquo;s free.\nSo the next step is how to implement a page view counter from data gethered by umami. If you see a page view counter on this website, it means my future-self has succeeded. If not, perhaps you\u0026rsquo;re too fast in reading this and I haven\u0026rsquo;t had time to implement it. Or perhaps I\u0026rsquo;ve died. Probably not though. I\u0026rsquo;ll have a writeup for that implementation when it is completed.

Amidst the chaos, one man stood out - Takashi, the traveling pickle salesman. He had been peddling his delicious, hand-crafted pickles for years, but today felt different.\nTakashi had received an invitation from none other than the infamous Chef Katsuhiko, a renowned culinary master in Tokyo\u0026rsquo;s esteemed kitchens. The chef was known for his exacting standards and discerning palate, but Takashi was determined to win him over.\nWith a spring in his step and a twinkle in his eye, Takashi set up his stall, carefully arranging his colorful jars of pickles on display. He had spent weeks perfecting the recipe, experimenting with different spices and flavors until he landed on his signature \u0026ldquo;Tokyo Sunset\u0026rdquo; pickle - a symphony of sweet, tangy, and smoky notes that would surely impress even the most discerning palate.\nAs the crowds began to swell, Takashi took his place behind the stall, greeting customers with a warm smile and a sample of his finest pickles. The day wore on, with potential clients sampling and savoring, but none seemed quite right for the elusive Chef Katsuhiko.\nJust as Takashi was about to pack up and head home, he spotted him - the chef himself, striding through the market with an entourage of assistants. Takashi\u0026rsquo;s heart skipped a beat as he hastily rearranged his stall, positioning his jars in perfect alignment and polishing the briny sheen on his glasses.\nChef Katsuhiko halted before Takashi\u0026rsquo;s stall, his piercing gaze scanning the array of pickles before him. For what felt like an eternity, the two men stood locked in silence, each waiting for the other to make a move. Finally, Chef Katsuhiko extended a hand, beckoning Takashi forward.\n\u0026ldquo;Ah, Takashi-san,\u0026rdquo; he said in a low, rumbling voice, \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ve heard so much about your pickles.

Together, they navigated the stalls, sampling and discussing the finer points of Japanese cuisine.\nAs the evening drew to a close, Takashi presented Chef Katsuhiko with a carefully selected jar of \u0026ldquo;Tokyo Sunset\u0026rdquo; pickles, adorned with a hand-painted label bearing his logo. The chef\u0026rsquo;s eyes narrowed as he examined the jar, then raised it to his nose and inhaled deeply.\nThe silence that followed was oppressive, until finally, Chef Katsuhiko spoke up - \u0026ldquo;These are indeed remarkable pickles, Takashi-san. I can already envision them paired with a perfectly seared Wagyu beef, or nestled within a delicate tempura shell.\u0026rdquo;\nTakashi beamed, his face flushed with pride. \u0026ldquo;Thank you, Chef Katsuhiko-sensei! It would be an absolute privilege to have my pickles featured in your esteemed kitchens!\u0026rdquo;\nAs the night drew to a close and Takashi packed up his stall, he felt like he was walking on air.

Kimber whipped up a batch of snickerdoodle cookies. It\u0026rsquo;s been grand!\nI\u0026rsquo;ve been taking pain pills for the surgical sites, but another pain has emerged. One that I didn\u0026rsquo;t really consider. Hand and finger pain. Allow me to explain.\nWhen I was getting my IV put in at the hospital, the nurse went from left arm to right hand in search of a vein. Apparently she found on in my right hand, rather high up near where my tendons bunch together that control my fingers. Between my middle and ring tendon, about an inch from my wrist. I can brush my left finger over the dot the needle made right now, and it feels like a cold shooting pain in my right ring finger.\nThere is also a bit of bruising on the back of my wrist. I stopped short, mid-sentence to say how much the needle hurt as it went in. She said, \u0026ldquo;Just hold still, try to relax.\u0026rdquo; My right hand had tensed up from the pain. I relaxed it and took some deep breaths.\nSo what\u0026rsquo;s the big deal? I probably wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be concerned if I hadn\u0026rsquo;t had passed out in the surgery prep room. Yeah, for the first time in my whole life (41 years) I passed out when there was a needle stuck in me.\nI didn\u0026rsquo;t say anything at the time because I thought that they were pushing sleepytime drugs in the IV, so I accepted the cold sensation creeping up my right arm and promptly fell asleep. I dreamed.\nA moment later (20 seconds later according to the nurse that was doing my vitals) I came to. \u0026ldquo;Mike! Mike! Mike!\u0026rdquo;, I heard as I came back to reality.\nSo\u0026hellip; now I\u0026rsquo;m more worried about my pain in my hand then the pain from where the surgeon cut in and took tissue for biopsy. Not a wonderful place to be in. I thought I\u0026rsquo;d write it down here as an account while it was still fresh in my mind.\nI\u0026rsquo;m going to put the link for the pictures here from my google photos for posterity.\nJan 11th\nUpdate Feb 17th, 2024: I\u0026rsquo;m writing here to inform you of good news on all fronts! Firstly and most importantly, the pathology on the 2 tissue removals came back clean. There was no irregularity or cancerous cells anywhere to be found. Great!\nI\u0026rsquo;m also pleased to report that my hand and wrist are almost back to normal. I\u0026rsquo;ve been doing slow stretches every morning and night, and whenever there\u0026rsquo;s a period of time between the action. It has no doubt helped.\nSo what have we learned here? Perhaps only have surgery if it is a nessecity, and make sure your viens are ready to be found and poked so the nurses don\u0026rsquo;t have to go a diggin.\n","permalink":"https://blog.virtualbeck.com/posts/hospital/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eListen to this article:\n\u003caudio class=\"custom-audio\" controls preload=\"none\" style=\"width: 100%;\"\u003e\n  \u003csource src=\"/audio/surgery.mp3\"\u003e\n\u003c/audio\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo days ago, I went in to the hospital to have a couple small skin tissues excised.

Whether that is a product of nature or nurture, I\u0026rsquo;d say nature. My parents love me and we have a great relationship. I\u0026rsquo;m naturally curious and concerned about others\u0026rsquo; feelings, but often I have a cold pragmatic response to emotional output. This has remained a constant throughout my life.. up until I started taking adderall.\nLast year, for me, was the year of caffeine. Mike on caffeine was like Mike+. I could do more work, get it done faster, and feel better physically. Have you heard of Monster energy drinks? Of course you have. You can probably even picture the Monster logo in your mind right now. It\u0026rsquo;s very heavily marketed. The sugar-free drink of choice contains 150mg of caffeine. Based on the product\u0026rsquo;s webpage for my favorite lime green drink in question - Ultra Paradise, it\u0026rsquo;s flavor profile is Kiwi Lime with a hint of Cucumber. I don\u0026rsquo;t know about that. It has always tasted like a green apple jolly rancher to me. Anyway, with 2 coffees and an Ultra Paradise down the hatch, it was game on. I was hooked on the feeling of ~300mg of caffeine pumping through my body.\nAt this point in the story is when something happens that makes the main character have to abruptly halt, and take another method. Sorry, nothing really happened. I was self-medicating myself with caffeine for about a year when I was enthusiastically sharing my thoughts with my wife. She, of course, was supportive of me and glad that I found something that helped me feel great and perform with concentration. At the same time, she was concerned about the amount of caffeine I was consuming. As a much more evolved person than me in every way, and certainly my better-half, she suggested that perhaps I have ADHD and caffeine was doing for me what her meds did for her.\nFunny enough, I was diagnosed with ADHD when I was younger (perhaps 13 or 14 years old) but was never medicated. My memory dictates that I was given the choice to take meds or not, and I had chosen to instead try to calm down using my mind over matter. I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t say I\u0026rsquo;ve ever struggled with ADHD in my life, but in the context of this story, there always seemed to be an emotional element missing. Did I need this emotion to function in life, or be successful in work? I\u0026rsquo;d argue, \u0026ldquo;No.\u0026rdquo;. Life pressed on and I learned to silently (and largely ignorantly) adapt largely without empathy.\nSo I talked to my doc about the possibility of having ADHD, discussed my unsafe (or at least unsustainable) amounts of caffeine consumption, and the possibility of having 10mg of adderall as a replacement. After a few months of thinking it over, I said yes and had the prescription filled. Overnight game changer. Although everything felt more clear and in focus from a mental standpoint, it wasn\u0026rsquo;t apparent to me that I had gained a sense of empathy until about a month in. It honestly feels like a new emotion to me. Like someone has been exhaustively trying to convey the color blurple to me through words only, and then finally revealed it with paint and canvas. It was the final piece to understanding a concept I\u0026rsquo;ve always dimly been aware of.\nSo now I\u0026rsquo;m on empathy pills, and I\u0026rsquo;m so glad for the change. If I can convey the feeling to you, the reader, through words it would be this: it almost feels like relating to someone else\u0026rsquo;s viewpoint or situation until I\u0026rsquo;m on the verge of crying. Perhaps that\u0026rsquo;s not actually the correct was empathy is felt for the majority of people. I\u0026rsquo;ll say this though, it is a vast self-improvement.\n","permalink":"https://blog.virtualbeck.com/posts/empathy-pills/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eListen to this article:\n\u003caudio class=\"custom-audio\" controls preload=\"none\" style=\"width: 100%;\"\u003e\n  \u003csource src=\"/audio/empathy-pills.mp3\"\u003e\n\u003c/audio\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll my life, I\u0026rsquo;ve never shown an immense amount of empathy.

Again, the fan is always silent on this computer. Lovely!\nI\u0026rsquo;ve been very impressed, and truly hope that the asahi linux team releases support for future apple silicon models.\nSide note: I was able to dual-boot this machine, so it runs MacOS too, and ollama runs natively on Apple silicon\u0026hellip;and it is fast.

They zipped through each yard, pail of goodies clutched tightly in their hands, while Mom and Dad tried to keep up! They were loving it. Little did we know, our car would later become an impromptu slumber party.\nAfter what felt like an eternity (2 hours), the kids started to show signs of wear. We\u0026rsquo;d gathered so much loot that it was starting to weigh them down.

Eating candy whilst collecting more candy. Like a small candy conveyor belt.\nWe went to play and hang out at a nearby friend\u0026rsquo;s house and they played for another couple hours while the parents hung out. Great night! When we got home, the kids tumbled out of the car, goodies cast aside, and promptly fell asleep.\nAs for me? Well, let\u0026rsquo;s just say I\u0026rsquo;m still recovering from the sugary onslaught. I had like 5 packets of Sweedish Fish, and feel hungover from all the sugar.

We all need to drop 20 lbs in 2 months. If you don\u0026rsquo;t hit the minus 20 pound mark by Oct 24th, you have to pay $100 per pound you missed. The max one person will pay is $2000. Split to 2 winners if needed.\nIf we all lose 20 pounds, then we are all fat losers! Which makes us winners.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s been interesting so far. I\u0026rsquo;ve eaten SO much differently this last month. Going to veggies and blue cheese dressing has had the most profound impact on satiating hunger in a way that doesn\u0026rsquo;t move the caloric intake that much. Also, I\u0026rsquo;ve grown to love peanut butter—the kind that is just nuts, none of that added sugar stuff. Get that noise out of here. So much sugar in everything that is not fresh, really astounding.\nWater intake is key. I\u0026rsquo;ve been pounding water and the seltzer waters too. It has been just over a month for me, and I\u0026rsquo;m down from 191.7 \u0026ndash;\u0026gt; 180.0 right now. Feeling good. I\u0026rsquo;d say the hardest thing is not eating when I\u0026rsquo;m bored. Just watching something on TV? Stomach/Brain: \u0026ldquo;WHY NOT EAT?\u0026rdquo; If that can be ignored, then the only thing I\u0026rsquo;ll need to change is the amount of walking I do. I average about 2000 steps per day. I\u0026rsquo;ll need to 3x that to move the needle on this back half of the weight loss.\nIf I can hit 171.7, I think I\u0026rsquo;ll be within the \u0026ldquo;normal\u0026rdquo; BMI range.. which is a totally bogus metric to live by. Seems the calculation is way off. Here\u0026rsquo;s my sample data, and the ranges.\nBMI Categories: Underweight = \u0026lt;18.5 Normal weight = 18.5–24.9 Overweight = 25–29.9 Obesity = BMI of 30 or greater Height: 5\u0026#39;10\u0026#34; Weight: 191.7 BMI: 27.5 Height: 5\u0026#39;10\u0026#34; Weight: 171.7 BMI: 24.6 Oct 16th update: I\u0026rsquo;m doing great. Today I\u0026rsquo;m at 177.9, which is almost 14 lbs down. I\u0026rsquo;ve got 8 days to drop about 6 more pounds. Not excited about that. The amount of food I\u0026rsquo;m taking in is waaaay less that before. If anything this competition has brought to attention the portion sizes I take on when it is not in the forefront of my mind. That and water intake. Always have water close by to curb the hunger. A lot of times when I\u0026rsquo;m feeling hungry, I think it just amounts to being thirsty and my mind is not able to distinguish between the two. I\u0026rsquo;ll post an update at the end.\nNov 2nd update: The contest ended on Oct 24th, and I lost a total of 17 lbs! The winner wound up losing 18, so I had to hand over $50, and it was worth it. Today is Nov 2nd, and I weigh exactly the same amount as 10 days ago. Hopefully 174 lbs is the new normal for me. I\u0026rsquo;ve been averaging 9000 steps a day and eating around 1800 calories. Not difficult. Weather has been great for walking and we also have a small walking treadmill for bad weather days.\nFeb 17th 2025 update: I\u0026rsquo;ve kept my weight off, and lost a bit more too. I\u0026rsquo;ve hovering around 169 now, which is about 11% reduction in body weight.

Something like this:\n\u0026quot;--providers.file.directory=/config/\u0026quot;\nThis way, you can specify the correct IP:PORT for traefik to use, rather than rely on labels. If you try to specify with labels, you will end up with an IP address assigned by docker within the host machine where traefik is running\u0026hellip; which is fine if you don\u0026rsquo;t want things to work.

By the time the fourth and fifth waves rolled around, I waved the white flag.

Back in my high school days of track and field, pushups were a staple (besides running, of course). And let’s not forget P90X at 26—pushups were the name of the game there, too. The aches in various muscle groups now remind me just how effectively pushups work your entire body.\nI’m committed to continuing this journey.

My friend wanted to have his Slack profile picture updated every 5 mins, so he wrote a program in Go to accomplish this. I am not that savvy with Go (yet), and I wanted to do my own implementation in Bash. Below is the code, only 4 lines really. Let’s look at each line and see what it is going on.\n# !/bin/bash # Upload a new picture to Slack profile to indicate your presence # put it in your crontab to send every 5 mins # */5 8–17 * * 1–5 /home/mike/slackProfilePic.sh # capture image from webcam (use /dev/video0 for default webcam) streamer -f jpeg -o /home/mike/image.jpeg -c /dev/video1 # introduce blur convert -blur 0x2 /home/mike/image.jpeg /home/mike/image.jpeg # send to slack (get your slack token here: https://api.slack.com/custom-integrations/legacy-tokens) curl https://slack.com/api/users.setPhoto -F “image=@/home/mike/image.jpeg” -F “token=xoxp-123–456–789” # remove image rm /home/mike/image.jpeg Walkthrough #!/bin/bash This is called the shebang, and it just tells the computer where the program bash lives. Any line that starts with a # means that is it a comment # */5 8–17 * * 1–5 slackProfilePic.sh is a comment, but also an example of how the script can be ran by the computer over and over on a cadence by cron (more here). This specific cron entry will run every 5 mins between the hours of 8am and 5pm, Monday through Friday. streamer -f jpeg -o /home/mike/image.jpeg -c /dev/video1 The capture line. Streamer is a program that captures audio/video. We are using it to just grab one frame from our webcam, and store it on disk in jpeg format. Read more about streamer here. convert -blur 0x2 /home/mike/image.jpeg /home/mike/image.jpeg The blur line (optional). This line was included to introduce a bit of blur to the newly captured image. I wanted to convey presence without sacrificing privacy. You may choose to change the amount of blur or do something completely different before uploading to Slack. curl https://slack.com/api/users.setPhoto -F “image=@/home/mike/image.jpeg” -F “token=xoxp-123–456–789” The upload line. Here, a curl request is used to send the new image to your Slack profile picture, using your Slack token. Much more can be found here about curl, and you can get your own token (and replace this one) here. rm /home/mike/image.jpeg The cleanup line. This line merely removes the local copy of the image we just uploaded to Slack. That’s it!

Host all your media in your own hardware. Upgrading Plex from a binary is not great. Letting docker run latest is the easiest way I’ve found to upgrade.
