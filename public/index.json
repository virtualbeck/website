[{"content":"Percy Picklesworth was a man on the brink. His pickle stand had been shut down twice that week alone, and his bank account was looking like a jar of sour pickles – empty and unfulfilling. He trudged along, his suitcase full of pickle jars, his spirit crushed.\nJust as he was about to give up, Percy spotted a colorful flyer on the bulletin board: \u0026ldquo;Unconventional Wisdom for the Unconvinced.\u0026rdquo; Intrigued, he ripped off a tab with an address and stuffed it into his pocket. This could be the turn of his life, he thought.\nPercy arrived at the address – a tiny cabin in the woods – and was greeted by a wise-looking woman named Zephyr. She welcomed him with open arms, led him to her living room, and handed him a steaming cup of tea flavored like lavender and disappointment (her signature blend).\nZephyr asked Percy about his pickle stand, and he shared his woes. She listened attentively, nodding along, before saying, \u0026ldquo;Percy, my friend, your problem isn\u0026rsquo;t the pickles or the customers – it\u0026rsquo;s your perspective.\u0026rdquo; Zephyr revealed that she\u0026rsquo;d spent years studying the art of misperception and how to flip it on its head.\nUnder her tutelage, Percy learned to see the world as a canvas, where every jar was a blank slate waiting for his creativity. He began to envision pickles not just as a food item but as instruments of joy – pickling utensils that could \u0026ldquo;pickle\u0026rdquo; memories into existence.\nIn no time at all, Percy\u0026rsquo;s pickle stand transformed into an immersive experience. People arrived expecting just vinegar and brine; instead, they discovered a world where every jar held a hidden story, a flavor so divine it defied explanation.\nWord spread about the Pickle Sage, and soon, people were flocking to see the most unconventional pickle salesman in town. Zephyr watched from the sidelines, smiling knowingly – Percy had discovered that sometimes, all it takes is a change of perspective to turn sour into sweet.\nTL;DR: A struggling pickle salesman meets an enigmatic woman named Zephyr who teaches him how to flip his problems on their head and find creative solutions. With her unconventional wisdom, he transforms his business and discovers the true potential of pickles.\nPrompt: Please write a funny story about a traveling pickle salesman who is down on his luck who meets someone who completly changes his life\\\\\u0026#39;s frame of reference.

One that I didn\u0026rsquo;t really consider. Hand and finger pain. Allow me to explain.\nWhen I was getting my IV put in at the hospital, the nurse went from left arm to right hand in search of a vein. Apparently she found on in my right hand, rather high up near where my tendons bunch together that control my fingers. Between my middle and ring tendon, about an inch from my wrist. I can brush my left finger over the dot the needle made right now, and it feels like a cold shooting pain in my right ring finger.\nThere is also a bit of bruising on the back of my wrist. I stopped short, mid-sentence to say how much the needle hurt as it went in. She said, \u0026ldquo;Just hold still, try to relax.\u0026rdquo; My right hand had tensed up from the pain. I relaxed it and took some deep breaths.\nSo what\u0026rsquo;s the big deal? I probably wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be concerned if I hadn\u0026rsquo;t had passed out in the surgery prep room. Yeah, for the first time in my whole life (41 years) I passed out when there was a needle stuck in me.\nI didn\u0026rsquo;t say anything at the time because I thought that they were pushing sleepytime drugs in the IV, so I accepted the cold sensation creeping up my right arm and promptly fell asleep. I dreamed.\nA moment later (20 seconds later according to the nurse that was doing my vitals) I came to. \u0026ldquo;Mike! Mike! Mike!\u0026rdquo;, I heard as I came back to reality.\nSo\u0026hellip; now I\u0026rsquo;m more worried about my pain in my hand then the pain from where the surgeon cut in and took tissue for biopsy.

Whether that is a product of nature or nurture, I\u0026rsquo;d say nature. My parents love me and we have a great relationship. I\u0026rsquo;m naturally curious and concerned about others\u0026rsquo; feelings, but often I have a cold pragmatic response to emotional output. This has remained a constant throughout my life.. up until I started taking adderall.\nLast year, for me, was the year of caffeine. Mike on caffeine was like Mike+. I could do more work, get it done faster, and feel better physically. Have you heard of Monster energy drinks? Of course you have. You can probably even picture the Monster logo in your mind right now. It\u0026rsquo;s very heavily marketed. The sugar-free drink of choice contains 150mg of caffeine. Based on the product\u0026rsquo;s webpage for my favorite lime green drink in question - Ultra Paradise, it\u0026rsquo;s flavor profile is Kiwi Lime with a hint of Cucumber. I don\u0026rsquo;t know about that. It has always tasted like a green apple jolly rancher to me. Anyway, with 2 coffees and an Ultra Paradise down the hatch, it was game on. I was hooked on the feeling of ~300mg of caffeine pumping through my body.\nAt this point in the story is when something happens that makes the main character have to abruptly halt, and take another method. Sorry, nothing really happened. I was self-medicating myself with caffeine for about a year when I was enthusiastically sharing my thoughts with my wife. She, of course, was supportive of me and glad that I found something that helped me feel great and perform with concentration. At the same time, she was concerned about the amount of caffeine I was consuming. As a much more evolved person than me in every way, and certainly my better-half, she suggested that perhaps I have ADHD and caffeine was doing for me what her meds did for her.\nFunny enough, I was diagnosed with ADHD when I was younger (perhaps 13 or 14 years old) but was never medicated. My memory dictates that I was given the choice to take meds or not, and I had chosen to instead try to calm down using my mind over matter. I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t say I\u0026rsquo;ve ever struggled with ADHD in my life, but in the context of this story, there always seemed to be an emotional element missing. Did I need this emotion to function in life, or be successful in work? I\u0026rsquo;d argue, \u0026ldquo;No.\u0026rdquo;. Life pressed on and I learned to silently (and largely ignorantly) adapt largely without empathy.\nSo I talked to my doc about the possibility of having ADHD, discussed my unsafe (or at least unsustainable) amounts of caffeine consumption, and the possibility of having 10mg of adderall as a replacement. After a few months of thinking it over, I said yes and had the prescription filled. Overnight game changer. Although everything felt more clear and in focus from a mental standpoint, it wasn\u0026rsquo;t apparent to me that I had gained a sense of empathy until about a month in. It honestly feels like a new emotion to me. Like someone has been exhaustively trying to convey the color blurple to me through words only, and then finally revealed it with paint and canvas. It was the final piece to understanding a concept I\u0026rsquo;ve always dimly been aware of.\nSo now I\u0026rsquo;m on empathy pills, and I\u0026rsquo;m so glad for the change. If I can convey the feeling to you, the reader, through words it would be this: it almost feels like relating to someone else\u0026rsquo;s viewpoint or situation until I\u0026rsquo;m on the verge of crying. Perhaps that\u0026rsquo;s not actually the correct was empathy is felt for the majority of people. I\u0026rsquo;ll say this though, it is a vast self-improvement.\n","permalink":"https://blog.virtualbeck.com/posts/empathy-pills/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eAll my life, I\u0026rsquo;ve never shown an immense amount of empathy.

What an accomplishment. You can find the homepage here, along with step-by-step instructions on how to get up and running. Wonderful!\nI installed the UI on the first go round, and took it for a spin for a few days. The overall user experience was good, but not as polished or smooth as I\u0026rsquo;d like.

Again, the fan is always silent on this computer. Lovely!\nI\u0026rsquo;ve been very impressed, and truly hope that the asahi linux team releases support for future apple silicon models.\nSide note: I was able to dual-boot this machine, so it runs MacOS too, and ollama runs natively on Apple silicon\u0026hellip;and it is fast.

The little monsters (aka kids) were determined to collect as much candy as humanly possible, and I\u0026rsquo;ve gotta give \u0026rsquo;em credit: they didn\u0026rsquo;t let a little rain dampen their spirits.\nAs we trudged from house to house, our damp tennis shoes squelching in the wet pavement, the kids\u0026rsquo; excitement only grew. They zipped through each yard, pail of goodies clutched tightly in their hands, while Mom and Dad tried to keep up! They were loving it. Little did we know, our car would later become an impromptu slumber party.\nAfter what felt like an eternity (2 hours), the kids started to show signs of wear. We\u0026rsquo;d gathered so much loot that it was starting to weigh them down. I started getting requests to \u0026ldquo;Hold my bucket\u0026rdquo; All I knew was they were dragging themselves along, candy wrappers clinging to their fingers and clothes like tiny little flags.

Like a small candy conveyor belt.\nWe went to play and hang out at a nearby friend\u0026rsquo;s house and they played for another couple hours while the parents hung out. Great night!

We all need to drop 20 lbs in 2 months. If you don\u0026rsquo;t hit the minus 20 pound mark by Oct 24th, you have to pay $100 per pound you missed. The max one person will pay is $2000. Split to 2 winners if needed.\nIf we all lose 20 pounds, then we are all fat losers! Which makes us winners.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s been interesting so far. I\u0026rsquo;ve eaten SO much differently this last month. Going to veggies and blue cheese dressing has had the most profound impact on satiating hunger in a way that doesn\u0026rsquo;t move the caloric intake that much. Also, I\u0026rsquo;ve grown to love peanut butter—the kind that is just nuts, none of that added sugar stuff. Get that noise out of here. So much sugar in everything that is not fresh, really astounding.\nWater intake is key. I\u0026rsquo;ve been pounding water and the seltzer waters too. It has been just over a month for me, and I\u0026rsquo;m down from 191.7 \u0026ndash;\u0026gt; 180.0 right now. Feeling good. I\u0026rsquo;d say the hardest thing is not eating when I\u0026rsquo;m bored. Just watching something on TV? Stomach/Brain: \u0026ldquo;WHY NOT EAT?\u0026rdquo; If that can be ignored, then the only thing I\u0026rsquo;ll need to change is the amount of walking I do. I average about 2000 steps per day. I\u0026rsquo;ll need to 3x that to move the needle on this back half of the weight loss.\nIf I can hit 171.7, I think I\u0026rsquo;ll be within the \u0026ldquo;normal\u0026rdquo; BMI range.. which is a totally bogus metric to live by. Seems the calculation is way off. Here\u0026rsquo;s my sample data, and the ranges.\nBMI Categories: Underweight = \u0026lt;18.5 Normal weight = 18.5–24.9 Overweight = 25–29.9 Obesity = BMI of 30 or greater Height: 5\u0026#39;10\u0026#34; Weight: 191.7 BMI: 27.5 Height: 5\u0026#39;10\u0026#34; Weight: 171.7 BMI: 24.6 Oct 16th update: I\u0026rsquo;m doing great. Today I\u0026rsquo;m at 177.9, which is almost 14 lbs down. I\u0026rsquo;ve got 8 days to drop about 6 more pounds. Not excited about that. The amount of food I\u0026rsquo;m taking in is waaaay less that before. If anything this competition has brought to attention the portion sizes I take on when it is not in the forefront of my mind. That and water intake. Always have water close by to curb the hunger. A lot of times when I\u0026rsquo;m feeling hungry, I think it just amounts to being thirsty and my mind is not able to distinguish between the two. I\u0026rsquo;ll post an update at the end.\nNov 2nd update: The contest ended on Oct 24th, and I lost a total of 17 lbs! The winner wound up losing 18, so I had to hand over $50, and it was worth it. Today is Nov 2nd, and I weigh exactly the same amount as 10 days ago. Hopefully 174 lbs is the new normal for me. I\u0026rsquo;ve been averaging 9000 steps a day and eating around 1800 calories.

Perhaps this will help you, but really it\u0026rsquo;s just my attempt get the info posted here so I can reference it later if needed, and move on.\nWhat is traefik? Traefik (pronounced traffic) is a modern HTTP reverse proxy and load balancer that makes deploying microservices easy. \u0026lt;\u0026ndash; ripped from github page. I\u0026rsquo;m using it to host my services (including this page you\u0026rsquo;re reading now). Some are public, some are private. Some are public behind an auth mechanism.

You just mention that, as I did above, and include a matching config file in the directory specified there. Something like this: `\u0026#34;--providers.file.directory=/config/\u0026#34;` This way, you can specify the _correct_ IP:PORT for traefik to use, rather than rely on labels. If you try to specify with labels, you will end up with an IP address assigned by docker within the host machine where traefik is running... which is fine if you don\u0026#39;t want things to work. Check this example out: http: routers: route-to-local-ip: rule: \u0026ldquo;Host(local-service.virtualbeck.com)\u0026rdquo; service: route-to-local-ip-service priority: 1000 entryPoints: - websecure middlewares: - authelia@docker tls: certresolver: - myresolver\nservices: route-to-local-ip-service: loadBalancer: servers: - url: \u0026ldquo;http://192.168.1.123:5592\u0026rdquo;\nThat\u0026#39;s about it.

In an attempt to shake off the cobwebs, I thought, “Why not do some pushups and get back in shape?” Of course, I was promptly reminded that “round” is indeed a shape.\nThat burst of motivation quickly met the cold, hard truth of physics. After years of cultivating my “mass,” I had to face the music—14 pushups was all I could muster. And this was before my morning coffee! As I grunted through the final rep on my bathroom floor, I thought, “No biggie. I’ll just do fewer reps throughout the day until I hit 50.”\n14 12 10 8 6 +-- 50 Easy, right? WRONG.\nThe second round started strong until I remembered how many I struggled to complete before my arms began to quiver. I managed just 3 before the shakes kicked in. In total, I barely squeezed out 12. Thank goodness that round was over!\nThe third wave? Pure agony. I finished, but only just. By the time the fourth and fifth waves rolled around, I waved the white flag. Here I am, two days later, typing this with pecs that feel like they’ve gone through a meat grinder—and my motivation to do more pushups? Well, it’s feeling pretty spent, too.\nYou might be wondering, “Why put myself through this?” To that, I say, “Why not?” I’m not 80 yet, and I’d love to slip back into the workout groove. Back in my high school days of track and field, pushups were a staple (besides running, of course). And let’s not forget P90X at 26—pushups were the name of the game there, too. The aches in various muscle groups now remind me just how effectively pushups work your entire body.\nI’m committed to continuing this journey. Who knows, I might even share my progress updates here to keep myself accountable. Here’s to reclaiming fitness, one shaky pushup at a time!\nMar 24, 2024: 30 May 31, 2024: 38 Jun 22, 2024: 10 Sep 27, 2024: 30 Update Nov 2, 2024: I\u0026rsquo;ve lost some weight, so I\u0026rsquo;m going to start doing weight training soom^tm.

My friend wanted to have his Slack profile picture updated every 5 mins, so he wrote a program in Go to accomplish this. I am not that savvy with Go (yet), and I wanted to do my own implementation in Bash. Below is the code, only 4 lines really.

Any line that starts with a # means that is it a comment # */5 8–17 * * 1–5 slackProfilePic.sh is a comment, but also an example of how the script can be ran by the computer over and over on a cadence by cron (more here). This specific cron entry will run every 5 mins between the hours of 8am and 5pm, Monday through Friday. streamer -f jpeg -o /home/mike/image.jpeg -c /dev/video1 The capture line. Streamer is a program that captures audio/video. We are using it to just grab one frame from our webcam, and store it on disk in jpeg format. Read more about streamer here. convert -blur 0x2 /home/mike/image.jpeg /home/mike/image.jpeg The blur line (optional). This line was included to introduce a bit of blur to the newly captured image. I wanted to convey presence without sacrificing privacy. You may choose to change the amount of blur or do something completely different before uploading to Slack. Read more about convert here]. curl https://slack.com/api/users.setPhoto -F “image=@/home/mike/image.jpeg” -F “token=xoxp-123–456–789” The upload line. Here, a curl request is used to send the new image to your Slack profile picture, using your Slack token. Much more can be found here about curl, and you can get your own token (and replace this one) here. rm /home/mike/image.jpeg The cleanup line. This line merely removes the local copy of the image we just uploaded to Slack. That’s it!
